"""The two ways to run Lemma locally must relax the same auth gates.

`lemma-stack` renders the environment for the Docker local stack and the
desktop install; the root `Makefile` builds it for `make dev`. Both are "Lemma
on your own machine", and both face the same fact: the gates that protect a
public deployment from strangers protect nothing on localhost, and several of
them actively obstruct the person developing.

They disagreed. `lemma-stack` turned off five; `make dev` turned off one. So the
documented way to run Lemma from a checkout refused an `@example.com` signup as
undeliverable, and locked the developer out of their own laptop for four minutes
after the sixth account in fifteen minutes -- while the Docker stack, the
desktop install, the e2e suite and the load tests all had none of that.

This does not ask anyone to keep one list. It asks that the lists say the same
thing, and it fails by naming the file that is behind.

usage: run_codeql.sh [--language python|javascript-typescript] [--all] [--base <ref>]

  --language  Analyse one language (default: both).
  --all       Report every finding, not just those in changed files.
  --base      Diff against this ref (default: origin/main, or $CODEQL_DIFF_BASE).

Results are cached under .codeql/; delete that directory to force a rebuild.
The evaluator is given half of physical memory, clamped to 4-16 GB; set
$CODEQL_RAM_MB to override.

"""Prove a built host pack is one the desktop app can actually start.

The pack is ~700 MB of relocated interpreter and standalone server that nothing
in CI had ever produced, let alone run. Every check that did exist was about
files being present, and presence is the one thing that is never the problem: a
relocatable CPython whose baked `sys.prefix` points at the build machine unpacks
perfectly, reports the right version, and fails the instant it is asked to
import anything -- on a user's machine, four minutes into a first run, behind a
progress bar.

So this executes what the pack ships rather than looking at it.

    python3 scripts/check_host_pack.py <pack-root>

Paths come from `desktop/contracts/host-pack-layout.json`, the same file
`native_host_pack.rs` and `build_local_host_pack.py` are pinned against, so this
cannot drift into checking a layout nobody produces.

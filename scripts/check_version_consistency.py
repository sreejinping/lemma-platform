"""Every Lemma-owned component must name the same version — checked at release.

Versions used to be forced apart branch by branch: regeneration refused a schema
change that did not also bump ``API_VERSION``, so a number naming a release that
had not happened climbed once per PR, and every schema-touching branch conflicted
with every other on the same handful of lines. Rebasing produced a version that
meant nothing.

Consistency still matters — a CLI built against one spec talking to a server
built from another is exactly the skew the version string exists to surface — but
it matters at the moment something is *published*, not at the moment it is
written. So the check lives here, and the release workflows run it against the
tag before publishing anything.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_version_consistency.py                 # all components agree
    python scripts/check_version_consistency.py --expect 0.7.0  # ...and match the tag
    python scripts/check_version_consistency.py --expect v0.7.0 # leading v is fine

Exits non-zero, listing every disagreement, when the components do not line up.
Add a component here the moment it carries a version people can install.

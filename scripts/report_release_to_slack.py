"""Announce a release in Slack, and say what is actually installable.

Not a "we shipped" message. The interesting half is the second one: it asks the
indexes what they are serving and prints that beside the version being
announced.

This exists because of 0.7.2. The GitHub Release was published on 2026-09-01 and
looked exactly like a release; PyPI and npm went on serving 0.7.1 for ten days,
because the release was created by a workflow and GitHub will not start a new
workflow run from an event the default GITHUB_TOKEN raised, so nothing that
publishes a package ever ran. Every dashboard said the release had happened. An
announcement that repeated that claim would have made it worse -- it would have
told the team a version was available that they could not install.

So a component that has not landed is named as missing, and the message says so
in its first line. The announcement is the check.

The prose comes from the changelog entry the release already has, in
``lemma-frontend/content/changelog/`` (what lemma.work/changelog renders), rather than from generated commit notes:
it is the one description of the release written for a person to read.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/report_release_to_slack.py 0.8.0
    python3 scripts/report_release_to_slack.py v0.8.0 --dry-run

Reads ``SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`` from the environment. Without it the message is
printed and the script exits 0 -- a missing webhook must not fail a release that
otherwise succeeded, and neither must a Slack outage.

"""Assert every aggregator job watches every job in its workflow.

"CI passed", "Backend E2E passed" and "Security passed" are the checks the
branch ruleset is meant to require. They are only as good as their `needs:`
list, and that list is hand-written: ci.yml already carries a comment recording
the time a job went missing from it and a wheel shipped without its skills
while the aggregator stayed green.

This file cannot see the ruleset, and the ruleset has been wrong. As of the CI
audit it required "lemma-backend unit" and "Backend E2E passed" -- so the whole
of ci.yml except one job, and the whole of security.yml, could go red without
blocking a merge, and "lemma-backend unit" is path-filtered anyway, meaning it
reported `skipped` (which GitHub counts as satisfied) on every pull request
that did not touch the backend. Keep the three names above and the ruleset in
agreement; there is no gate that can do it for you.

Also checks that every job declares `timeout-minutes`. Without one a job runs
to GitHub's six-hour default, which is not a timeout so much as a way to
discover a hang the next morning.

"""Which lines a change touched, and which CodeQL findings have been accepted.

Shared by `make codeql` (through run_codeql.sh and summarize_codeql.py) and the
pull-request comment in `.github/workflows/security.yml`, so the terminal and
the PR scope a finding to "this change" by the same rule.

The rule is line ranges, not filenames. A file-level scope reports every
pre-existing finding in any file you touched: renaming one import in a
600-line module made it look like the module had sprouted seven new problems.

Run as a filter, it turns `git diff -U0` into the `path:start-end` lines that
summarize_codeql.py reads:

    git diff -U0 origin/main...HEAD | python3 scripts/codeql_scope.py

Standard library only, and no syntax newer than 3.9: CI runs it with the
runner's system Python, and run_codeql.sh with whatever `python3` is on PATH.

"""Balance the backend e2e shards from measured test time.

The shard layout used to be hand-written in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`, and it
drifted: the slowest shard ran 467s while the fastest ran 172s, so more than
half of the fan-out sat idle waiting for one runner. This script reads the
JUnit XML every shard already uploads and re-packs the modules so the shards
finish together.

Usage:

    # from the artifacts of a green run
    python scripts/plan_e2e_shards.py --run-id 32460493224

    # or from an already-downloaded directory of junit-*.xml
    python scripts/plan_e2e_shards.py --junit-dir /tmp/e2e-junit

The result is written to `.github/e2e-shards.json`, which the workflow reads
with `fromJSON`. Regenerating it is a reviewable diff on purpose: shard balance
is a fact about the suite, and a fact about the suite belongs in the tree
rather than in a step that recomputes it invisibly on every run.

# another in the same run. So treat `estimated_seconds` as "which shard is the

# the async workers the tests are waiting on. It shows up as a *condition*
# wait timing out with a generous budget rather than as a slow assert:
# test_apply_destructive_requires_confirmation blew a 90-second wait for a
# bundle import, intermittently -- green on one run, red on the next with the
# same shard contents.

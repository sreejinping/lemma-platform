"""Make Lemma Desktop's runtime archives stable across releases.

A release ships two runtime archives per platform: the host pack and the
guest runtime. Every release rebuilt both, and neither build is reproducible
-- the guest image installs packages at build time, `mkfs.ext4` writes a fresh
UUID and hash seed, and the archives carried build-time mtimes -- so two builds
from one commit published different bytes, and every installed Lemma
downloaded the whole guest again on every update.

Three pieces live here:

``fingerprint``
    A digest over exactly what determines the guest runtime's content: the
    build script, the image definition and its overlay, the boot-asset
    preparer, this file (it writes the archive), the guest daemon binary that
    goes into the image, the target, and a package epoch. It is computed before
    the image is built, so a release whose fingerprint matches an earlier one
    can skip the build entirely.

``reuse``
    Find the newest published release whose manifest records the same
    fingerprint for the target, download its archive, check it against that
    manifest's SHA-256 and size, and hand it back to be republished unchanged.

``zip``
    Write an archive whose bytes depend only on the tree: sorted entries, a
    fixed timestamp, normalised permissions, no directory entries and no build
    paths. That makes a rebuild of an unchanged tree stable too, but it is not
    what the reuse depends on -- the guest's *tree* is not reproducible.

``workspace-image``
    The same arrangement for the workspace sandbox image: its input
    fingerprint, and the published image built from the same inputs, if any.
    On Desktop the image's digest is the sandbox's identity, so a new digest
    replaces every sandbox and downloads the image again at the next Wake up.

Standard library only: the release jobs run it with the runner's own Python.

/**
 * Slack hands you an app pre-built from a manifest, so nothing below has to be
 * copied by hand — not the callback URL, not the event URL, not the scopes.
 *
 * What a manifest cannot carry is credentials: Slack has no API that gives a
 * third party another app's client id, client secret or signing secret. They
 * exist only on the app's own Basic Information page. So the floor is one
 * click and three pastes, and this button removes everything above that floor.
 *
 * Lives on its own rather than inside the credential form it used to sit in:
 * making the app is what *produces* those credentials, so it is a peer of the
 * form, not a field in it — and it is the same offer wherever someone first
 * runs out of Slack accounts to pick, which is the surface modal as often as
 * the connector list. Nothing here is scoped to a pod, an org or an account,
 * so rendering it twice is not two of anything: the manifest describes the
 * deployment, and an org may run as many Slack apps as it likes.
 *
 * `agentName` is the one thing that does vary: a Slack app is a single bot
 * user, so an app made for one agent arrives already named for it rather than
 * as a second thing called Lemma. Passing nothing still makes the shared bot.

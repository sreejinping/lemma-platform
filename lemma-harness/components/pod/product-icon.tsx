/**
 * Every product glyph is a `regular` outline in every state — at rest, under
 * the pointer, and while selected. Weight and fill are deliberately not
 * expressive axes here: a column of these icons is read by silhouette, and a
 * glyph that thickens or fills on interaction changes how much ink one row
 * carries relative to its neighbours, which is exactly what makes a nav look
 * unsettled. The day-to-day kinds each carry their own jewel tone in every
 * state (see `.lemma-product-icon[data-kind]` in primitives.css) — colour is
 * the place's identity and stays put, while the pointer is answered by a
 * small scale in CSS and selection by the row's fill and accent bar.

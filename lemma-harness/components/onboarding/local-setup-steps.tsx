/**
 * The two questions only a local installation has to answer.
 *
 * Hosted Lemma has models of its own and is reachable by definition. A Lemma
 * Desktop install has neither settled until someone settles it, and both were
 * previously buried in a separate settings webview that onboarding never
 * mentioned — which is how a user could finish setup and find agents did not
 * work.
 *
 * Everything here is answered in place. An earlier pass split this into a
 * provider step and an agents step and sent the provider half to Local settings
 * to be completed, which is the correct security boundary and the wrong
 * product: onboarding cannot ask "which model?" and then open a different
 * window for the answer. The boundary moved instead — `configure_ai_provider`
 * reaches one narrow daemon command that merges the AI section and cannot touch
 * sharing, tunnels, or the runtime — so the question and its answer live
 * together.

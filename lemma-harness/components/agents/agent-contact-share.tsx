 * the obvious next thought is to pass that on to a person who does not have a
 * Lemma account. Everything the card needs is already loaded — no second fetch,
 * and no endpoint that has to decide whether a stranger may ask.
 *
 * What it copies is a link, not a file. The `.vcf` is one click further on, on a
 * page that also unfurls in the chat someone pastes it into — and a preview card
 * with the agent's face on it is what makes the link worth opening. A bare file
 * attachment says nothing until it is already saved.
 *
 * **Lem gets one too.** It is the pod's front door, so its card is the most
 * useful one a pod can hand out — but it is also the same name and the same face
 * in every pod, which no other agent is. So its card is named for the pod it
 * answers for; without that, saving Lem from two pods leaves an address book with
 * two identical rows and no way to tell which is which.

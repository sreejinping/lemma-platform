 * Onboarding — where a new user actually meets this list — rendered the display
 * name and an Add button, and nothing else. So a Claude Code that was installed
 * but signed out looked exactly like a working one, was offered for adoption,
 * and failed on save; or worse, saved, and failed in the first chat instead.
 *
 * Everything about *what this harness is* lives here. What a caller may do with
 * it does not: the action slot is theirs, because "Add to models" and "Use in
 * chats" are genuinely different offers made in different places.

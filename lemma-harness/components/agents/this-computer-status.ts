/**
 * The pairing that belongs to the workspace being looked at, if any.
 *
 * A computer can be paired to several workspaces at once — that is what
 * `targets` is — but the card read `targets[0]` and every control was gated on
 * `paired`, meaning "paired to anything". Open a hosted workspace on a Mac that
 * had been paired to its own local stack and the card described the *local*
 * pairing: it reported a dead workspace as this one's status, and "Recheck
 * agents" re-polled a URL this workspace has never heard of.
 *
 * The automatic connection asks the same question and must get the same answer,
 * or a machine that is paired to something would never pair to the workspace
 * actually on screen.
 *
 * A target with no URL matches nothing: it cannot be shown to be this
 * workspace's, and guessing wrong is what this fixes.

// workspace are both running, and neither will pick up a run.

// In a hosted workspace the first poll is the one that has to start locald, so
// "nothing yet" is the normal opening state and a failure there — no daemon, a
// build without the sidecar — left an empty space where the only way to connect
// this computer should have been.
//
// Every state here is now a report, never a prompt. There is no Connect, no
// Turn on and no Disconnect for this computer, so "not paired yet" and "not
// running yet" are both stages of an automatic connection rather than things
// waiting on the user — which is why neither says "Off". "Off" was a real state
// only because there was a switch to hold it there.
//
// Lives beside the card rather than in it so it can be tested as the pure
// function it is, like `agent-runtime-helpers` next door: the card is a client
// component and the unit suite deliberately loads no React.

                true of it. The browser holds the session now, so signing out
                signs it out.

                It then said "clear cookies" and hedged about local storage,
                which was true of a bug rather than of the design: the relay
                only ever sent bare hosts to `clearDataForOrigin`, and local
                storage is keyed by full origin. Measured after the fix, on
                the origin that produced the original report -- cookie and
                localStorage both gone.

                One case is still not reached: an origin on a non-default
                port with no page open, because nothing then names the port
                and cookies do not record one. It is deliberately not in the
                copy below. This card lists sites somebody signed in to
                through the browser -- `github.com`, a webmail, a dashboard
                -- and none of them carry a port; a caveat that cannot apply
                to anything in the list is noise in front of a destructive
                action. `forget_domains` records the same limit where it can

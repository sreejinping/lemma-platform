/**
 * An agent's own email address, rendered as the address it is.
 *
 * Every agent gets one the moment it is created, and until now the platform's
 * only way of saying so was a chip in the "Reached by" row that truncated it —
 * `roundtable@ops.lemm…`, an unreadable string beside an empty icon box. An
 * address is not a status: it is a thing a person copies and gives to someone
 * else, so the two affordances it needs are legibility and copy.
 *
 * The local part carries the weight and the domain goes quiet. Every managed
 * address in a deployment shares one domain, so drawing both at the same weight
 * spends the line on the half that identifies nothing — and, in a chip, is
 * exactly which half gets truncated away.

     * "People will be able to email it at …" already carries the tense, and a

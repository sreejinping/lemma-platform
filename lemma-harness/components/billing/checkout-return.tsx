 * What the customer sees on the way back from hosted checkout.

 * The redirect proves nothing: the payment provider activates a subscription by
 * webhook, which lands seconds later. So this waits for the status to actually
 * move rather than congratulating anyone on the strength of a query parameter,
 * and says plainly what is happening while it waits.
 *
 * Uses the same `state-surface-*` notice language as the rest of the app rather
 * than a bespoke card, so a billing page does not announce things differently
 * from every other screen.

 * The analytics switch, on the page that explains analytics.

 * comes back, so this is the only place the answer can be revisited — which
 * makes it part of the document, not a decoration on it.
 *
 * It reports three genuinely different situations rather than flattening them
 * into on/off: nobody has answered yet, someone answered, or analytics does not
 * run on this deployment at all and there is nothing here to switch.

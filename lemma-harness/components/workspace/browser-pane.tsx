    // ⌘C on a Mac reaches a Linux browser as Super+c, which copies nothing.
    // The keystroke that works over there is Ctrl+c, so the native gesture is
    // translated rather than passed through -- otherwise the person's muscle
    // memory silently does nothing, and macOS also tends to swallow the keyup
    // of a ⌘-combination, leaving the modifier stuck down on the far side.
    //
    // Paste is the one that has to get *out* of this handler intact, and the
    // reason is in noVNC. Its keyboard binds `keydown` on the canvas and ends
    // every single one with `stopEvent`, which is `preventDefault` plus
    // `stopPropagation`. A preventDefaulted keydown is exactly the thing a
    // browser will not follow with a `paste` event -- so the handler below,
    // which is what writes the text to the remote clipboard, never ran, and
    // pasting a password into the pane silently did nothing.
    //
    // This runs in the *capture* phase on the container, which is an
    // ancestor of that canvas, so it sees the keystroke first. Stopping
    // propagation here means noVNC's listener never fires, never
    // preventDefaults, and the browser goes on to emit the native `paste`
    // that `onPaste` is waiting for. Deliberately **no** `preventDefault` on
    // this branch: that would suppress the very event we are trying to
    // provoke.
    //
    // Both modifiers, because ⌘V is the gesture on macOS and Ctrl+V
    // everywhere else -- and the Ctrl+V case was broken differently: it fell
    // past the `metaKey` guard into noVNC, which dutifully sent Ctrl+V to the
    // far side, where it pasted whatever the *remote* clipboard happened to
    // hold. Nothing had ever written to it.

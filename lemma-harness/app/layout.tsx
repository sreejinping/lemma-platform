// stylesheet while the assets it names have already been rotated away -- so
// they are per-edge, unreproducible, and immune to retries beyond luck.
// Vercel's own guidance for CI is to self-host, and there is no Next option
// that makes the fetch deterministic.

// Fontsource ships the same Google-hosted files as versioned npm packages, so

// request at all. `npm run build` now succeeds with fonts.googleapis.com
// blocked, which is the property being bought.

/**
 * Every family below is declared here so its CSS variable is global — the token
 * chain in `styles/tokens.css` resolves against all of them, and a family scoped
 * to a route group would silently fall back to system text wherever else it is
 * referenced.
 *
 * `preload` is a separate decision from declaring. A preloaded family emits
 * `<link rel="preload">` into every document, so it competes for bandwidth on
 * the critical path of routes that never paint a single glyph of it. Only the
 * faces that `--font-body-family`, `--font-display-family` and
 * `--font-mono-family` actually resolve to earn that:
 *
 *   body    → Inter → system
 *   display → Inter → system
 *   mono    → DM Mono → ui-monospace
 *
 * The rest are landing, legal, greeting and document faces: no app route paints
 * them above the fold. They still load the moment a matching rule applies —
 * `preload: false` removes the eager fetch, not the font.

// Body *and* display face — product and landing share one voice. 600 exists
// because landing reserves it for the fake product chrome in its mockups, and
// dense real UI needs Inter's own semibold rather than a synthesized bold.
// Variable files carry the whole weight axis in one request, so the weights
// each face declares below are the range the family actually supports rather
// than the handful the design uses. `wght` is the pure weight axis: the `opsz`
// and `full` variants Fontsource also ships add an optical-size axis that
// would render differently from the static weights this replaced.
// Subsetted and axis-trimmed by scripts/subset-inter.sh, and committed —
// this is the one face preloaded on every route, so its bytes are on the
// critical path for every visitor.
//
// Fontsource ships the file Google publishes; Google *serves* a tighter cut of
// it. Taking the package file as-is put 47.1 KB on that path against the
// 35.2 KB the Google loader used to fetch, which the bundle budget correctly
// refused. The script re-cuts it to Google's own `latin` unicode-range and
// narrows the weight axis to the 300-600 the design has always had, landing
// under the previous figure. `weight` below must match that axis.

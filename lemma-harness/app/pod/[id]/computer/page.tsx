/**
 * The sandbox, at full size: its files, and its browser.
 *
 * A route rather than only the pane beside a conversation, for the reason
 * anybody opens a file manager or a second browser window: looking through a
 * machine, or watching one work, is a thing you do for a while, in a window,
 * not in a sidebar you are also trying to read a conversation next to.
 *
 * Both live here rather than on two routes because they are one thing --
 * `ComputerPanel` is already "the agent's computer, in one panel" with these
 * same two tabs, and the full-screen version should be that panel at full
 * size rather than a different arrangement somebody has to relearn.
 *
 * The conversation layout's comment argues against exactly this -- "a
 * workspace is keyed to the person and only means anything in the
 * conversation that has been using it, so a URL you could navigate to cold
 * would be a page that cannot say whose files it is showing". The first half
 * is true and the conclusion does not follow: the files and browser APIs take
 * no identifier at all, they resolve *the caller's own* sandbox from the
 * session. There is exactly one machine this can be showing, and it is yours.
 *
 * `view`, `path` and `file` live in the URL so a view survives a reload and
 * can be sent to yourself. They are a position, not a permission: the same
 * session check answers either way.
 *
 * All the chrome goes through `ResourceHeader` rather than a header of this
 * page's own. The first version drew its own title band under the shell's,
 * which put the word "Computer" on screen three times -- workspace tab,
 * context bar, page heading -- and spent two rows plus a sentence of
 * explanation before the thing the page exists to show. `titleOwner="tab"`
 * is the shell's own answer to that, and the switch belongs in the bar
 * beside the title, where a mode switch goes.

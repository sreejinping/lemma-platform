/**
 * Every table in the pod, on one line, with the open one underlined.
 *
 * This replaces a dropdown hung off the page *title*. A title is not a control:
 * nothing about "Projects ⌄" said other tables existed, and the same slot meant
 * "folder" on the files side, so the one visible switcher on the screen changed
 * meaning depending on which tab you were in.
 *
 * It renders inside the table toolbar rather than above it — "which table" and
 * "what can I do to it" belong on one line. Creating a table is the page
 * header's job, so there is no `+` here; two create buttons a centimetre apart
 * is not discoverability.
 *
 * Tabs take `lemma-index-tab` — the same underline the Workflows and Functions
 * ledgers use — rather than a second tab look invented for this page. No counts:
 * the tables list has no row totals in it, and a strip of em-dashes is worse
 * than no column at all.
 *
 * A pod with more tables than fit gets a strip that scrolls, and the scrollbar
 * is hidden here on purpose — which left the overflow reachable by trackpad and
 * by keyboard and by nothing else. On a wheel mouse the tables past the edge
 * were not merely awkward: there was no gesture that reached them and no mark
 * saying they were there. `useHorizontalOverflow` gives the wheel to the strip
 * and fades whichever edge still has something behind it.

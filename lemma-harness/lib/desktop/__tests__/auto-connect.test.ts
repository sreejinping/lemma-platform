// The bug this file exists for: the guard against connecting twice was a
// `useRef`, so it was per mount. Two components on one page call the hook —
// `ThisComputerCard` and the setup banner, which is on every page that has a
// card — and both mounted, both saw "not paired here" in the same commit, and
// both minted a pairing code. One machine arrived in the workspace twice, and
// because the host keeps one target per workspace URL the first of the two was
// orphaned and sat there permanently offline.

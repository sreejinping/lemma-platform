// The bug this file exists for: a pod app embedded in the workspace loaded
// permanently signed out on macOS, and its SDK refreshed for ever trying to
// repair a session it could never store.
//
// `localhost` is not in the Public Suffix List, so WebKit cannot derive a
// registrable domain and treats `<slug>.apps.lemma.localhost` as a different
// *site* from `app.lemma.localhost`. Measured in a WKWebView harness, that
// iframe gets no storage at all: the server's Set-Cookie is not kept, a
// `document.cookie` write is silently dropped, a credentialed fetch answers
// 401, and `hasStorageAccess()` is false. No cookie attribute changes it.
//
// Chromium and WebView2 treat `*.localhost` as same-site, so this is macOS
// only -- which is exactly why it reproduced in the shipping app and nowhere
// else.

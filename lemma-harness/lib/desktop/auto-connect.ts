/**
 * Connect this computer to the workspace on screen, without being asked to.
 *
 * Pairing exists because a Lemma workspace can drive agents on machines it does
 * not run on — you name the computer, mint a code, and carry it over. None of
 * that applies to the machine you are sitting at: you are already signed in on
 * it, and the Agent Host is a sidecar this app supervises. Making them press
 * "Connect this computer" was asking for consent that was already implied, and
 * it read as broken, because pairing takes a moment and the harness scan takes
 * longer still — so the honest-looking outcome of pressing it was nothing, then
 * nothing, then "no agents found".
 *
 * So it happens on its own, once per page, as soon as an authenticated page is
 * open in the app. What the user is then asked is the only question actually
 * left: which of the agents we found do you want in your chats.
 *
 * This is the whole connection lifecycle. There is no Connect, no Turn on, and
 * no Disconnect for this computer, so there is nothing for an automatic
 * connection to fight with and no "did the user say no?" flag refereeing the
 * two. Removing a machine you are *not* at is a different act with a different
 * mechanism: `agent.host.revoke`, which is durable server-side because the
 * machine is not there to re-pair itself.
 *
 * Hosted workspaces get this too. The gate used to be `isLocalDeployment()`,
 * which meant the cloud user — the one who most needs an explanation of how
 * their laptop joins a workspace running somewhere else — was the only one left
 * pressing buttons.
 *
 * macOS may prompt for file access the first time an adapter probes for an
 * installed agent. That prompt belongs to the agent's own binary and cannot be
 * pre-empted from here; what this does is make sure it happens early, while the
 * user is still in setup, rather than after they press a button and conclude it
 * did nothing.
 */
/**
 * Which workspaces this page has already tried to connect to, and why the last
 * try failed.
 *
 * Module-level, not a `useRef`. The ref was per mount, and two mounts is the
 * ordinary case rather than a corner: `ThisComputerCard` and the setup banner
 * both call this hook, and the banner is on every page that has a card. Both
 * saw "not paired here", both claimed their own attempt, and both minted a
 * pairing code — so one machine arrived in the workspace twice, and because the
 * host keeps one target per workspace URL, the first of the two was orphaned
 * and sat there permanently offline.
 *
 * Deliberately not persisted. It is a guard against doing the same work twice
 * on one page, not a record of anything the user decided — there is no connect
 * or disconnect for this computer, so there is no decision to remember. A
 * reload is a fresh start, which is also what makes it safe to leave a failure
 * in it.

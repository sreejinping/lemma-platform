 * from `<slug>.apps.lemma.localhost` into a workspace on
 * `app.lemma.localhost` is therefore third-party, and WebKit blocks its

 * empty, a credentialed fetch to `/_lemma/users/me` answers 401, and
 * `document.hasStorageAccess()` is false. The app loads permanently signed out

 * is why the answer is a window rather than a redesign.

 * `platform` is baked from `std::env::consts::OS` and cannot change for the
 * life of the process, unlike `mode` (see `readDesktopBridge` above for what

 * corrects itself the moment the local hostnames move to a real registrable
 * domain — no flag to flip, no shell change, and the fallback path when that

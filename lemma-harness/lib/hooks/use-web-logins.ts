 * The sites this person's sandbox browser is signed in to.
 *
 * Read from the browser, not from a table, so there is nothing to page
 * through: it is what one browser is holding. The helper that followed
 * `next_page_token` to exhaustion went with the table -- along with the
 * history listing, which had nothing left to record once no server-side copy
 * of a login existed to do anything to.
 *
 * `wake` is off until somebody asks. A paused computer answers `sleeping`
 * rather than being started, because opening a settings page should not be
 * what spins one up -- and unlike the old table read, this one costs a round
 * trip into the sandbox.
 *
 * `enabled` is the same argument one step earlier. The card that opens this
 * list sits on a page of eighty connectors, and asking a sandbox anything to
 * render a door nobody has opened is a round trip spent on nothing.

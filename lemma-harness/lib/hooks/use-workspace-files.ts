 * into the user's home so that everything a tool writes to `~` -- `~/.npm`,
 * `~/.cargo`, a browser profile -- survives a suspend along with it; projects
 * then live one level down in `~/lemma`. The frontend kept asking for
 * `/workspace`, which stopped existing, and a missing directory listed exactly
 * like an empty one, so the pane showed a working, empty folder instead of a
 * mistake.
 *
 * Both are defaults, not the answer: every listing carries `home_root` and
 * `workspace_root`, and the pane prefers those. Serving them is what stops
 * this drifting a third time -- a constant here can only ever be as current as
 * the last person to remember it.

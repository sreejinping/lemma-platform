/**
 * Handing a pod an unfinished sentence instead of a sent message.
 *
 * `assistantMessage` was the only way to arrive at a pod with intent, and it
 * always fires: the layout reads it and sends immediately. That is right when
 * the user has already said what they want, and wrong every other time — it
 * spends a model turn on a sentence they never wrote, in a pod they have not
 * seen yet.
 *
 * A composer launch is the quiet version. `composerDraft` seeds the pod's own
 * composer and stops there, cursor at the end, while `conversationInstructions`
 * waits with it and rides along on whatever the user eventually sends. It never
 * survives that first message: background framing for the build is not standing
 * policy for the pod.

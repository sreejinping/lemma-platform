/**
 * Is this `icon_url` a picture, or a glyph someone typed?
 *
 * A pod's whole visual identity is one nullable text column, `icon_url`. There
 * is no emoji field on the entity and none can be smuggled through `config` —
 * `PodConfig` is a closed pydantic model, so unknown keys are dropped on parse,
 * silently. The column, the entity and all three API schemas already accept any
 * string, and `IconService.get_managed_storage_path` ignores anything outside
 * the managed icon route, so a bare emoji stored there is inert on the backend:
 * it round-trips, it travels through bundle export/import, and it is never
 * mistaken for a file to garbage-collect.
 *
 * What it is *not* is a URL, and the field name says it is. That lie is the
 * price of shipping this without a migration, and this module is where it is
 * paid: every "is it a glyph?" decision in the product happens here, so the day
 * a real `icon_emoji` field exists, this is the only file that changes.

 * the Slack pickers, `pod_default` on the wire and "the default agent" in the
 * product spec — for one actor that answers most of a pod's conversations.
 *
 * "Assistant" could not be the fix. [docs/product/README.md] fixes the product's
 * nouns against the analytics event catalog, and `assistant` is not among them
 * and appears nowhere in any journey; adopting it would have meant amending an
 * enforced vocabulary to add a *category* that competes with `agent`. A proper
 * name needs no such amendment — Lem is an instance, the way someone's own
 * agent is `triage` — and it is the only form that reads in the first person on
 * the front door, where "Hey, I'm Pod Assistant" was a job title introducing
 * itself.
 *
 * A *lemma* is the step proved so the real result can happen, which is the job.
 * This is display copy only: `pod_default` and `POD_DEFAULT` are wire values
 * and stay exactly as they are.

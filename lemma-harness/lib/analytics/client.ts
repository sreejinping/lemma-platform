/**
 * Product analytics for the web client.
 *
 * The backend is the primary emitter (docs/design/product-analytics.md §5):
 * anything with a state change is captured off the domain event bus, which
 * covers every origin including the ones with no browser present. This file
 * therefore emits only what the server cannot see — navigation, funnel steps
 * abandoned before any API call, and client errors.
 *
 * Four settings are deliberate and must not be relaxed:
 *
 * - **autocapture off.** Lemma renders customer business data: table records,
 *   agent transcripts, file contents. Autocapture harvests DOM text into event
 *   properties, which is the fastest possible way to put a customer's records
 *   into a third-party analytics database.
 * - **session replay off.** The same reason, more so.
 * - **`before_send` is the export boundary.** Every event passes through it,
 *   whatever the call site, so the client gets the same default-deny posture the
 *   backend emitter has. `sanitize_properties` is deprecated and is not used.
 * - **cookieless until consent.** Persistence starts in memory and is upgraded
 *   only once someone accepts. See `consent.ts`.

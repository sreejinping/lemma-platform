"""The pod's own agent is called Lem, wherever a person can read it.

It answers to three stored spellings and no name at all, and every one of them
used to reach a person somewhere: `pod_default` in a notification header and an
email `From`, `Lemma` -- the *product* -- as the username a chat bot posted
under. The frontend has mapped this since the name was chosen; the backend had
the mapping written out four times, in two different values, none of them
next to the wire name they were mapping from.

"""Delegated authorization token claims and workload delegation constants.

Delegation-scope convention: contexts minted for a single operation carry a
minimal scope (e.g. a function tool call sets ``{function.execute}``; the
scope check is implication-expanded, so the implied ``function.read`` is
admitted too). Long-lived agent contexts (sub-agent runs, pod data-access
tools) are deliberately unscoped — the workload's explicit resource grants
and the destructive-action gate are the limiters there.

The pod-default agent's two names also live here, together and on purpose.
``DEFAULT_POD_AGENT_NAME`` is what the row carries and what a token claims;
``DEFAULT_RESPONDER_NAME`` is what a person reads. They were apart, and the
display name lost: the change that gave the pod's agent a real row normalised
every place that had faked one to the *product* name, because nothing beside the
wire value said the actor already had a name of its own.

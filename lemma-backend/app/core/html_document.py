"""Wrap an HTML fragment into a full standalone document.

Conversation widgets are authored as HTML *fragments* (no doctype/html/head/
body — the display_resource tool enforces this). To serve a widget the same way a
app is served — a full page the browser SDK can run in — the fragment is
wrapped into a complete document here. Promotion preserves the source fragment but
uses the standalone wrapper, which intentionally omits conversation-only padding and
height messaging.

Pod context (window.__LEMMA_CONFIG__) is injected separately by
app.core.runtime_config; this module only builds the document shell.

# Keeps an in-conversation iframe integrated with its host: reports rendered height
# and applies the host's ``--lemma-widget-*`` theme payload. The bridge is kept out
# of promoted standalone apps, whose fallbacks remain system-theme aware on their own.
#
# The theme is taken by PREFIX rather than from a list of names. A curated list was
# a guess at what a widget would ever want to draw, and it guessed low: the host
# frontends send state colours, the ink for an accent fill, soft accents and the
# corner scale, and every one of them was dropped on the floor here. So a widget
# could not paint a green "done" or an amber "waiting" and had to reach for the
# accent, which is why every status in every widget came out the same colour. What
# is left is the part that is about soundness rather than taste: this is a style
# sink, so a value carrying CSS syntax is refused, and the payload is bounded.

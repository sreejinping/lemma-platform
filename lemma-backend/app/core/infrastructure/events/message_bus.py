        reached by any group holding in-flight unacked work -- which is what a
        healthy group under load looks like at every instant. Warning on each
        one reports health as a fault: a single signup burst produced 2123
        identical lines in two minutes, 99% of the worker's entire output, and
        a real fault would have been invisible inside it.

        nobody is a group whose subscriber was deleted, and the answer is the

        reads identically. Production spent three weeks publishing
        ``schedule_events`` at its hard ceiling because a group abandoned in

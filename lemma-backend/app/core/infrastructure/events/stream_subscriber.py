    that cannot validate can never be acked, so it stays in the pending-entries

    Returns the number of groups (re)created. Two cases need this:

    1. **Startup race.** Multiple subscribers can share one stream (e.g. both the
       workflow and surface subscribers consume ``schedule_events``). At
       ``broker.start`` FastStream races to create each group, and a subscriber
       that issues XREADGROUP before its group exists gets NOGROUP, which ends
       its consume task; FastStream's supervisor restarts that task at once and
       with no backoff, so the subscriber spins on NOGROUP until the group is
       back. Calling this once before ``broker.start`` pre-creates every group
       so no subscriber races. Pass ``warn_on_create=False`` there: creating a
       group on a fresh (or flushed) Redis is expected, not an anomaly.
    2. **Mid-run loss.** If a group is later lost — Redis flush, failover to an
       un-replicated replica, key eviction, or stream trim — recreating it on a
       short interval lets the retrying subscriber's next attempt succeed
       without a restart.

    Groups are created at ``$`` (new messages only): after a data-loss event the
    old entries are gone anyway, and this avoids reprocessing a whole surviving
    stream. Never raises — group plumbing must not crash the worker.

    Case 2 is reported at WARNING and an ensure failure at ERROR. Both used to
    be ``logger.debug``, which ``LOG_LEVEL=INFO`` drops before formatting, so
    the one accident that stops delivery on a self-host left an empty log. They
    are rare by construction — a group is created once per stream per Redis
    lifetime — so this is not a volume trade, and the whole pass reports once
    rather than once per group so a Redis outage cannot turn a tick into a
    burst.

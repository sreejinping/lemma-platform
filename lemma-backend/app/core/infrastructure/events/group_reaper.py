"""Consumer groups nobody declares any more, and how to know that safely.

Nothing removes a Redis consumer group when the code that consumed it is
deleted. `surface-schedule-events` outlived PR #509 by months: zero active
consumers, a last-delivered-id frozen at the commit that deleted its subscriber,
and -- because the byte-budget trim then took the minimum across *observed*
groups -- an XTRIM MINID watermark that could never advance past it.
`schedule_events` reached 825MB against a 256MB budget, and Redis hit `maxmemory`
twice, which took login down with it. (The budget now trims past such a group
when it must; see ``stream_budget``. Reaping still matters: until it happens,
every guard pass that needs the room records a gap for a group nobody reads.)

The hard part is not destroying the group. It is knowing that it is dead.

"Not in this process's registry" is not evidence. A process declares the topology
of the modules it was assembled with, and a deployment can install a superset of
another's. Destroying a group a different deployment still consumes deletes its
pending-entries list, and every delivery in flight with it.

So the evidence is not a registry, it is a *claim*. Every process that ensures
consumer groups already enumerates exactly the set it owns, once per
``consumer_group_reconcile_interval_seconds``; that pass now also stamps each
pair into a ledger in Redis. A group becomes a candidate only when nobody in the
fleet has claimed it for a whole grace window, and three independent liveness
facts agree: nothing pending, nothing delivered recently, no consumer that is
not idle.

Two guards are load-bearing and easy to lose:

* :func:`owned_streams` is deliberately **not** ``observable_streams()``. That
  set also carries the streaq lane queues, and streaq creates a group named
  ``workers`` on each of them. A reaper pointed at the observable set would find
  ``workers`` undeclared on every tick and destroy the job queue's
  pending-entries list, taking every in-flight job with it.
* The ledger stamps its own creation time. Until it is older than the grace
  window the reaper refuses to act at all -- otherwise the first deploy, or any
  Redis that has been flushed, sees every group unclaimed and destroys the whole
  topology.

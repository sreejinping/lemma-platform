"""A poison message must leave the pending-entries list. Proved against real Redis.

Everything about this failure lives below the application: whether a handler
that raises gets acknowledged, whether an unacknowledged entry stays pending,
and whether ``XAUTOCLAIM`` hands it back. None of that can be observed with a
fake broker, which is exactly why the defect shipped — the surface e2e suite
publishes to Redis and calls handler logic separately, and its own docstring
says "there is no consumer wired into the e2e test client".

So this runs a real ``RedisBroker``, with the real subscriber decorator and the
real quarantine middleware, against a real Redis, and asserts on ``XPENDING``.

It also pins the one assumption the unit tests cannot check: that swallowing an
exception in ``consume_scope`` leaves FastStream's acknowledgement middleware —
which sits *outside* ours — seeing a clean return, and therefore acking. If
FastStream ever reorders those, the counts below go non-zero and this fails.

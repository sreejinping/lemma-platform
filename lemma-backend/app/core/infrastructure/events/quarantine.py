"""Dead-letter a stream message that can never succeed, instead of retrying it forever.

Redis Streams do not drop a message the consumer never acknowledges. It stays in
the pending-entries list, and the reclaim subscriber hands it back every minute
for as long as the deployment lives. For a *transient* failure that is exactly
what you want. For a message that can never be processed it is a permanent
background load and permanent log noise, and it drowns the error rate that real
failures have to show up in.

That is not theoretical. One malformed publish to ``surface_events`` ran at ~119
redeliveries an hour in development, off two stuck messages that had each been
delivered more than 680 times.

Two ways out, and both are needed:

* **Known-permanent errors** — a payload that fails validation will fail
  validation identically on every redelivery. There is no point in a second
  attempt, let alone a thousandth. Quarantined on the first failure.
* **A delivery-count backstop** — for everything else. A "transient" failure that
  is really permanent (a bug on a code path only this message reaches) would
  otherwise loop forever, so a message that has failed enough times is
  quarantined whatever the error looked like.

The conservative direction is deliberate: the permanent set is *closed* and small,
and anything unrecognised is re-raised so normal redelivery still gets its
chances. A message is only ever given up on because it provably cannot succeed,
or because it has already had more attempts than any real transient fault needs.

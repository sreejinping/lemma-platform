"""Is this process's schema the one its code was written against?

``/health/ready`` used to answer with a ``SELECT 1``, which proves the database
is up and nothing about whether it has the columns this build needs. During a
rolling deploy that is the difference PS-OPS-030 exists to name: a new replica
reports ready against the old schema and starts serving traffic that fails on a
missing column -- errors that read as application bugs and send the reader to
the wrong code. ``lemma-stack`` gates this externally by running migrations as a
one-shot before the backend starts; a Kubernetes or hand-rolled deployment has
no such gate.

Two cheap reads, both cached hard once they agree: the head revision the shipped
migration scripts define, and the revision the database says it is at.

"""Stop the worker when a lane has stopped, instead of letting it look healthy.

A worker process runs two kinds of long-lived consumer: FastStream stream
subscribers (one reader task per subscriber) and streaq lanes (one worker task
per lane). Either can end while the process carries on:

* FastStream restarts a reader that raised -- unless the task ended
  *cancelled*, and a ``CancelledError`` leaked in from a client bound to some
  other task does exactly that. The subscriber still reports ``running``.
* The secondary streaq lanes are plain background tasks. When one crashed, its
  traceback was logged once and nothing ever ran it again.

Both happened together in development: the bulk lane crashed at 06:03, the
``datastore-file-events`` reader and its reclaimer died on the fallout within a
minute, and the worker went on reporting healthy for more than four hours
while ``datastore.events`` grew until Redis ran out of memory.

The repair is not to restart the task in place. What killed it -- a poisoned
connection pool, a corrupted cancel-scope stack -- is process state, and a task
restarted into the same process meets it again. So this watchdog's only move is
to take the process down cleanly and let whatever supervises it (Kubernetes, the
compose restart policy, Desktop's host process manager) start a fresh one:

1. report which lane died and why, once, at ERROR;
2. mark the process unhealthy, which stops the liveness heartbeat and the
   Redis ``alive`` key -- so even with no probe configured, readiness stops
   vouching for it;
3. deliver SIGTERM to itself, so the normal graceful shutdown runs;
4. and, as a last resort, hard-exit if that shutdown does not finish.

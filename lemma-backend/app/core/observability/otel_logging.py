"""Where OpenTelemetry meets Python's ``logging`` module, in both directions.

Two halves of one seam, split out of :mod:`telemetry` because they are the only
part of it that is about log records rather than about standing providers up.

Outbound: the app's structured records are bridged onto OTLP by
:class:`SanitizingLoggingHandler`, which copies across a fixed allowlist of
bounded fields and nothing else — a log pipeline is the easiest place for a
message body or a customer's name to leave the deployment, and a bridge that
forwarded whatever was on the record would be exactly that.

Inbound: the OTLP exporters log their own failures through the same ``logging``
module, once per failed export. A collector that is down or not yet serving
turns that into a wall of identical lines during precisely the outage somebody
is trying to read, so :func:`quiet_otlp_export_logs` rate-limits them.

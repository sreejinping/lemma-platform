"""Event-loop lag watchdog + liveness heartbeat.

The worker and API run everything on one event loop; if something blocks it, the
process stops making progress but the OS process stays alive, so nothing
restarts it. This watchdog makes a wedged loop *observable* and *actionable*:

- It schedules a wake-up every ``interval`` and measures how late it actually
  fires. That delay is the event-loop lag; a healthy loop is ~0, a blocked loop
  climbs. The value is exposed via :func:`get_loop_lag_seconds`.
- It writes a heartbeat file (current epoch seconds) each tick. A wedged loop
  can't update it, so an external liveness probe can check the file's freshness
  and restart the process. This is how the worker (which has no HTTP server)
  gets a liveness signal; the API additionally serves ``/health/live``.

Loop-lag telemetry is **stateful**. While degraded, the in-memory maximum lag is
tracked without emitting a warning on every tick; a single
``runtime.loop_lag.degraded`` event fires after three warning samples or one
five-second unhealthy sample. Recovery emits one
``runtime.loop_lag.recovered`` event after 30 healthy seconds, so threshold
jitter does not alternate events.

Mirrors the background-task shape of ``_consumer_group_reconcile_loop`` in the
streaq runtime: started in the lifespan, cancelled on shutdown.

    The last sample alone is a poor probe answer: a process that spent four
    seconds wedged reports the stall on exactly one probe and reads healthy on
    the next, so a liveness check on a multi-second interval sees a wedged
    process as fine nearly every time. Hence the tail -- a stall stays visible
    for ``_LIVENESS_STICKY_SECONDS`` after it ends, long enough for a prober to
    catch it.

    It is deliberately NOT the ``_degraded`` flag, which holds for
    ``_RECOVERY_HEALTHY_SECONDS`` (30) so the telemetry does not flap. Liveness
    is not telemetry: with a typical ``periodSeconds: 10`` and
    ``failureThreshold: 3``, a 30-second unhealthy window is exactly a kill, so
    tying liveness to it converts every recovered stall into a guaranteed
    restart.

    A loop that is genuinely wedged keeps failing the current-lag check on its
    own merit and still gets restarted -- stickiness only ever changes the
    answer for a process that has already recovered, which is the one case
    where restarting is pure harm.

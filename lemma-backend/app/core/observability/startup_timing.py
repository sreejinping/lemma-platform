"""Name every startup step and how long it took.

A calm API boot measured ~80s to a bound port: ~15s of imports, then ~45s in
the lifespan with nothing logged between the first line and ``service.started``.
Nothing could say which step it was, because no step said anything. Kubernetes
kills a pod that has not bound its port by the liveness deadline, so a boot that
drifts past it restarts, and the restart is just as slow -- the length of this
window is a correctness property, not a nicety.

One info line per step is cheap (a boot has a few dozen) and turns "startup is
slow" into "this step is slow".

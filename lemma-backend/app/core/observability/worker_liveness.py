"""Worker liveness, published where another process can read it.

The loop watchdog already writes a heartbeat file every tick, and that file is
the right signal for a liveness *probe* -- something running beside the worker,
on the same filesystem, that can restart it. It is the wrong signal for
readiness, because the process that has to answer `/health/ready` is usually not
the process with that file: `python -m app.worker` runs beside `uvicorn` in the
container stack and in the documented Kubernetes layout, and only the
single-process desktop build has both in one place.

So the watchdog also refreshes two Redis keys, and the API reads them:

``lemma:worker:alive``
    Short TTL. Present only while a worker has ticked recently, so a wedged loop
    -- which cannot refresh it any more than it can refresh the file -- lets it
    expire.

``lemma:worker:seen``
    Long TTL. Present if a worker has run against this Redis at all recently.

Both are needed because "no key" has two meanings. A deployment that runs no
worker at all -- an API-only test process, a developer running `uvicorn` alone --
must not be reported unready for a component it never had; a deployment whose
worker *was* there and is now silent must. ``seen`` is what tells those apart,
and its window is the bound on the answer: a worker gone for longer than that
stops being reported, because at that point nothing in this Redis remembers it
and readiness would be guessing.

Deliberately not a per-replica registry. The question readiness asks is "is
there a worker able to take this work", not "how many are there" -- so every
replica refreshes the same two keys and any one of them alive is enough.

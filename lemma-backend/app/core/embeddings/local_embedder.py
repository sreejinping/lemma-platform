    Called at process start, from the entrypoint, before the event loop
    exists. That timing is the whole point, and on Windows it is the
    difference between the desktop app starting and never starting at all.

    Imported the ordinary way -- lazily, on first use, from inside the running
    app -- this import does not finish. Every Windows start reached
    "worker.lanes.starting" and stopped there: uvicorn binds its listening
    socket only after the ASGI lifespan returns, so nothing ever listened and
    locald reported "backend failed health gate: connection timed out". Stacks
    taken from the stuck process showed a thread inside `create_module` for
    `numpy._core._multiarray_umath` -- a `LoadLibraryExW` -- and another thread
    in `Thread.start()` waiting for an anyio worker that could not begin,
    which is what streaq asking anyio to read its Lua file looks like.

    What is measured, on a real Windows machine, from the installed app:

    * the import takes 5.3s cold and 0.7s warm in a fresh process, and 0.7s
      even with the whole stack running -- it is not slow;
    * done lazily from inside the app it did not finish in three minutes, on
      four consecutive runs, on a worker thread *and* on the loop thread;
    * done here, at process start, it takes 0.8s and the stack reaches ready
      in sixteen seconds with the preload fully enabled.

    So the fix is the timing, not the thread: before the loop, before the
    lifespan, before anything else is holding a lock worth deadlocking on.

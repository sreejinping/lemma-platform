"""Origin has to survive the two hops that separate work from its own events.

``DomainEvent.origin`` is read from a contextvar at construction, and the events
that matter most are constructed far from where the work arrived: in a streaq
task minutes later, or in a consumer in another process. Both hops therefore
carry origin explicitly, and this file holds them honest.

Without this, every schedule, trigger, import and surface message produces
events with a null origin -- and three catalog entries are origin-pinned, so
they would be dropped outright by ``emitter.emit`` and log a contract violation
on every occurrence.

    looks like it removes something and removes nothing; `or protected` looks
    like it adds a lane's worth of tests and adds none. Someone reading the
    protected lane's filter would reasonably believe it covers more than it
    does.

    This does not fail on a reserved marker -- it fails when the reserved list
    and reality disagree in either direction, so a marker that starts being used
    gets taken off the list, and a marker that quietly dies gets noticed.

    """Two streaq workers in one pytest process fight over one Redis queue.

    `agent_surfaces` overrides the session-scoped `worker` fixture with its own
    (its Composio transport differs), which is legitimate. What is not safe is
    both it and the base `worker` being instantiated in the same process: they
    share the per-xdist-worker Redis database, so they consume from the same
    streaq queue, and `production_worker_process` calls `flushdb` on entry --
    so the second one to start wipes the first one's queue.

    Today's layout avoids this by luck: `agent_surfaces` is packed with
    `identity`, which asks for no worker at all. But the layout is generated by
    an LPT packer, so a regeneration could pair it with `agent`, `pod_bundle`,
    `schedule`, `datastore` or `workflow` and turn a green suite intermittently
    red for reasons that would look nothing like the cause. This fails the
    build at review time instead.

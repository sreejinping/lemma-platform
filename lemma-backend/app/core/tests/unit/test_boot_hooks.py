"""Every module boot hook is named here, with why it is allowed on the boot path.

A lifespan hook runs before a process serves anything, on every replica, on
every restart. One that walks the data -- a backfill over every pod schema, a
repair over every row -- is cheap on the day it is written and grows with every
pod created afterwards, until it is the slowest thing the process does and
nothing says so. That is how a grant backfill came to own most of API startup.

Adding a hook means adding a line below, and the line has to say why the hook
does not scale with data. A backfill does not belong here at all: it belongs in
a migration, or in a worker job. See the boot-hook note in AGENTS.md.

"""Multipart uploads must not use a part size the object store will reject.

The GCS and S3 XML multipart APIs require every part except the last to be at
least 5 MiB. ``obstore.put_async`` already defaults ``chunk_size`` to exactly
that (5_242_880), so the correct call passes nothing at all.

Three call sites used to override it *down* to 1 MiB — the Azure Blob block-size
convention, left behind by the Azure-to-GCS move. Any staged upload larger than
1 MiB then produced a first part of 1 MiB and failed with::

    EntityTooSmall: Part 1 has size of 1048576 bytes, which is smaller than
                    min part size (5242880 bytes)

Under 1 MiB the upload is a single part, and the last part is exempt from the
minimum, so small files succeeded and hid it. It reached production on datastore
file upload before anyone noticed.

This is a static gate rather than a runtime one because the failure only appears
against a real GCS/S3 endpoint. ``test_multipart_upload.py`` is the runtime
counterpart: a >5 MiB upload against moto's S3 server, which enforces the same
minimum.

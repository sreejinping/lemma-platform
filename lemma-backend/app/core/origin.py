"""How work entered the platform, as one canonical noun.

``ActorType`` (``app.core.authorization.context``) says *who* acted. This says
*how the work arrived*, which is a genuinely independent question: people chat
through the web UI and through surfaces, agents usually work through the SDK —
but people use the SDK too, and agents post to surfaces. Collapsing the two
into one field makes "how much of this pod's work is human?" unanswerable.

The platform already used the word *origin* for this in two narrower places —
``Conversation.origin_type`` (a loose string) and ``NotificationOriginKind``
(an enum covering notifications only). This is the canonical spine both should
converge on. It is deliberately *not* called "surface": a surface is a specific
product noun — a chat platform where an agent answers pod members — and it is
one origin among many.

Origin is resolved once at the edge and carried in a contextvar, the same way
:mod:`app.core.request_context` carries request and correlation ids. Work that
no request started — schedules, table triggers, outbox consumers — sets its
origin where it is enqueued rather than leaving it to be guessed downstream.

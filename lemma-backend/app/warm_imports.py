"""Pay the heavy imports at startup rather than on somebody's first request.

Three of the libraries this backend depends on are large enough that importing
them is visible work, and all three are imported lazily on purpose:
``check_import_budget.py`` and ``test_startup_import_laziness.py`` both exist to
keep them off the module graph of a process that only serves health checks.

Lazy is right, and it moves the cost rather than removing it. Measured against
this tree, the first agent request pays 0.5s to import
``runtime_model_factory`` (800 modules, pulling ``openai``, ``anthropic`` and
``pydantic_ai``), another 0.5s for ``metered_model`` (1,112 more), and about
three seconds the first time anything counts tokens, because ``tiktoken`` has to
fetch and build its vocabulary. On the event loop, in a request, that is a stall
every other request in the process shares.

So the modules stay lazily imported and a startup task imports them anyway --
which is the same trade `ensure_task_lanes_registered` already makes one line
below it in the lifespan.

Two things this is not. It is not a guarantee: ``importlib`` holds a per-module
lock, so a request that loses the race waits for the warm-up rather than
skipping it, and gains nothing. And it is not a correctness dependency -- every
failure here is logged and dropped, because a backend that cannot import
``tiktoken`` should still serve the requests that do not need it.

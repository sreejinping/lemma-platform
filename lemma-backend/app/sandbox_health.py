"""Whether this deployment could provision a sandbox if it were asked.

`build_provider` already raises a specific, actionable error for every
misconfiguration it can see -- a missing `WORKSPACE_RUNTIME_CREDENTIAL_KEY` or
`WORKSPACE_LOCAL_RUNTIME_CLI` or `E2B_API_KEY`, an E2B metadata namespace it
refuses to derive. It is just called lazily, from the sandbox composition, so
the first thing that ever read one of those errors was a user's first tool call,
arriving as `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` with nothing actionable in it. A host with no
Docker at all did not get even that: nothing looks at the socket until an HTTP
request reaches the engine, hours after the install reported itself healthy.

So the API probes once at startup and publishes the answer as a capability. The
exception text goes to the log, where the operator is; the capability carries
the setting to look at and nothing more, because `/health/capabilities` is
unauthenticated.

Lives outside `app/core` deliberately: the probe has to name a concrete fabric,
and `app/core` is what the modules are built on rather than the other way round.

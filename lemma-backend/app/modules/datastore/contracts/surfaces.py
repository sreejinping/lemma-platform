"""What a chat surface reads and writes in a pod's datastore.

Six operations, not the three service *factories* `app/composition/surface_datastore.py`
handed out. `build_table_service` was the worse half: a table preview needed a
`TableContext`, and the only way to build one was
`table_service.schema_manager.get_schema_name(pod_id)` -- a collaborator reached
off a service, in another module, to learn a schema name that datastore alone
should have to know. `agent_surfaces` also had to hold `TableContext` itself,
for one call.

The file half is the same shape as `provisioning`'s, with the two reads that
provisioning has no use for: a surface card shows what a document *looks* like,
so it renders a page to an image, and it needs the entity before the bytes
because a file over the platform's cap is described rather than attached.

A submodule for the same reason as its siblings here and in `schedule` and
`connectors`: these reach the service layer, and `contracts/__init__` is imported
by anything that wants any contract at all.

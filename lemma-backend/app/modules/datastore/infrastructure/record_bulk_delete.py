"""Delete many records in one transaction, and say what did not match.

`delete_record` is right for one row and wrong N times, for the same reasons
`record_bulk_update` gives: it opens its own session, sets the RLS context,
runs the DELETE, stages its event and commits, per row.

Atomicity is why this one had to move, though, not latency. `PS-DATA-013`
promises a bulk change applies all of its records or none of them, and that a
rejected one is named. Bulk delete did neither: it committed each row on its
own, so a batch that failed partway left the earlier rows destroyed with the
caller holding an error and no way to learn which; and an id matching nothing
was swallowed and quietly left out of the count, so "deleted 3" and "deleted 3
of the 5 you asked for" read identically. Destroyed rows are the worst place
in the module to leave that ambiguity.

Repeated ids are collapsed rather than reported: asking twice for the same row
to be gone is not a request that failed.

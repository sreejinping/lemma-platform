    The two cache knobs are the ones that are not about timeouts, and they are
    here rather than on the primary engine because only this one runs SQL
    against tables a person can change.

    Prepared statements are cached per connection, keyed on the SQL text. A
    record read is ``SELECT * FROM "<schema>"."<table>"`` — the same text before
    and after a column is added or removed, and the same text for two pods whose
    tables share a name, because the pod is selected by ``SET LOCAL search_path``
    rather than by anything in the statement. So a cached plan is reused with a
    result descriptor that no longer matches the table.

    Worse than one bad request, because the connection is pooled. Any request
    landing on it hit the same failure, and it cleared itself only when the
    connection recycled — a table that broke and then healed with nothing done
    in between. Which operation triggered it was never about the operation but
    about which connection served the next read; ``pool_use_lifo`` makes that
    reliably unpredictable.

    **Both names are required, and only one of them is the one that matters.**
    ``statement_cache_size`` is asyncpg's own; ``prepared_statement_cache_size``
    is SQLAlchemy's, which the asyncpg dialect implements on top because it
    prepares every statement itself, and which defaults to 100 per connection.
    Setting only asyncpg's — which is what this did — leaves SQLAlchemy's cache
    fully active, so the fix this docstring describes never took effect. It cost
    59 HTTP 500s in a single day in production, all from
    ``execute_readonly_query``, as ``InvalidCachedStatementError`` and as raw
    protocol desyncs (``the number of columns in the result row (1) is different
    from what was described (2)``, ``unexpected trailing 942 bytes in buffer``,
    ``cannot decode UUID, expected 16 bytes, got 554``).

    Twice, now. DEV-DATA-004 was closed in #505 by setting only asyncpg's knob,
    and the register entry was deleted in the same change -- so ``issues.md``
    said this was fixed while every deployment with a real pool still had it.
    SQLAlchemy documents the hazard plainly: a cached prepared statement goes
    stale "when DDL has been emitted to the PostgreSQL database which modifies
    the tables", and the dialect can only invalidate its cache within one
    process and engine, which is not the arrangement here.

    It was found the second time from two directions at once -- the production
    500s above, and the product scenario suite run against a real install.
    Nothing cheaper could have: in ``testing`` this engine pools with
    ``NullPool``, so no connection lives long enough to reuse a stale statement
    and the entire failure is invisible to a booted test stack.

    The cost is a parse per statement. That is the right trade for a schema
    that belongs to users rather than to migrations: the primary engine keeps
    its cache, because its tables change only at deploy time.

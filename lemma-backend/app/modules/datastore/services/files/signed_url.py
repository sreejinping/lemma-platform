"""Public, hit-capped, short signed URLs for datastore files.

Unlike the stateless HMAC tokens in ``file_url.py``, these links are looked up
rather than decoded, so we can:

- keep them **short** (a random code, not an embedded payload) — easy for an
  agent to copy/paste and pass around, and
- enforce a **maximum hit count** per link so a leaked link can't run up
  unbounded egress on a large file.

Two stores, and which owns what is the whole design:

**Postgres owns whether the link exists**, where it points, and when it dies.
A link is a capability grant, not a cache — it is all that stands between a URL
and someone's file — and it now lasts up to seven days. Redis durability is a
property of the deployment rather than of this code (the compose stack snapshots
every 60s with no AOF; managed key-value services differ again), so a link that
lived only there survived or vanished according to how the operator had
deployed. That is not a lifetime anyone can promise a recipient. The row is also
what makes revocation possible at all: you cannot kill a link that exists only
as a key nobody has listed.

**Redis owns the spend counter**, and caches the claims so the common fetch
touches no database. The counter deliberately stays lossy. ``/s/`` is
unauthenticated and unrate-limited, so a database write per byte-serving fetch
would be an anonymous write lever and would serialize every reader of a popular
link on one row — worse since Range landed, because a video player issues dozens
of requests per view. And it fails the right way round: lose Redis and links
still resolve while budget accounting resets, where losing the record instead
would kill links that are perfectly valid. Expiry still bounds a link whose
counter was lost.

Resetting the budget that way is accepted, not tolerated. The cap exists to stop
a *leaked* link running up unbounded egress; it is not an accounting guarantee,
and nothing bills against it. Losing one link's worth of counting to a Redis
failover costs at most one link's worth of extra egress, which is well inside
what the cap was ever meant to prevent. Do not "fix" this by moving the counter
into Postgres — the paragraph above is why. If it ever needs to be tighter, the
move is a windowed budget (per hour, say, checkpointed durably), which bounds a
failover's loss to one window instead of the whole link and still keeps the hot
path in Redis.

The code *is* the capability: anyone holding ``{api_url}/s/{code}`` can fetch the
bytes (until the link expires or its budget is spent). Bytes are streamed
**through the backend** (``GET /s/{code}``) rather than redirecting to a real
object-store signed URL — that is the only way the cap actually bounds egress.

The cap is a **byte budget**, not a request count: ``max_hits`` whole copies of
the file. It reads as a download count to a caller, which is how it is named and
documented, but counting requests was wrong in both directions. A revalidation
(304) or a link-unfurling bot's HEAD transfers nothing and used to cost a whole
download — enough that a browser reloading a PDF killed its own link, since
``no-cache`` makes it revalidate every time. And a ranged request transfers a
slice, so a video player seeking through a file would have spent a download per
seek. Charging the bytes a response actually commits to gets both right and is
what "bounds egress" meant in the first place.

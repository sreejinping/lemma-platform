        This is the *rate* limit that `PS-DATA-041` needs in order to be
        affordable. That promise is deliberate and works: a document whose
        converter is unreachable is returned to PENDING with its attempt
        refunded, so an outage never exhausts a file's retry budget. What it
        does not do is bound how often the hopeless claim is retried -- and this
        dispatcher re-picks every PENDING file on every pass. Four unreadable
        files were enough to re-drive continuously and stall the worker's event
        loop, in a deployment where the visible symptom was agent replies going
        slow in unrelated pods. One tenant's unreadable PDFs became everybody's
        latency, which is the shape `PS-DATA-042`'s backpressure exists to stop
        for uploads.

        Deferring rather than skipping matters: the files stay queued and still
        drain by themselves once the extractor returns, so nothing waits on the
        next cron tick. The attempt counter is untouched either way, so
        `PS-DATA-041` is unaffected -- what changes is how often a hopeless
        claim is retried, not how many failures it is charged with.

"""What a document's ``last_processing_error`` is allowed to say.

Two different failures end up in the same field and want opposite treatment.

A failure *about the document* — a corrupt PDF, an extractor that choked on a
file — must be summarised to nothing but its class. Provider bodies, object
keys, SQL, URLs and credentials all appear in exception messages, and this
string is served back through the API.

A failure *about the deployment* — no embedding provider is configured, the
endpoint is unreachable, the ``vector`` extension is absent — is not the
person's document and never will be. Collapsing it to
``"ProgrammingError: document processing failed"`` is how a whole-install
misconfiguration presents itself as "every document I upload says it failed",
with nothing anywhere naming the setting that is missing. `PS-DATA-021` already
decided this for the query facility, where a missing datastore query role now
answers 503 with an explanation instead of blaming the caller's SQL; ingestion
had no equivalent.

So facility-absent failures are recognised here and answered with a message
this module wrote — never with the provider's own text, which is exactly the
material the summary exists to keep out.

Recognition is by message shape, like ``_query_facility_is_absent``, because
the causes arrive as whatever type the provider client raised: the
OpenAI-compatible embedder turns every transport failure into a bare
``Exception``, and the pgvector cases arrive as driver errors naming no table
and no column. What is matched is the platform's own wording where possible
(the embedder raises its own "requires LEMMA_OPENAI_API_KEY" message) and
PostgreSQL's stable catalogue wording otherwise.

A file that fails this way still spends its processing attempt and reaches
FAILED_PERMANENT, deliberately: unlike an extractor blip, an unconfigured
embedding provider is a standing state, so refunding the attempt would mean an
unbounded re-drive loop with no terminal status and nothing recorded anywhere.
Failing with a message that names the setting stops, and says why.

The one embedding failure that is *not* standing is the local model's first
download. The model is fetched once, on first use; a machine that is offline
at that moment recovers by itself as soon as it is online. That case arrives
as ``EmbeddingModelUnavailableError``, is still classified ``embedding_provider``
here (it is not the document's fault), but the processing service refunds the
attempt for it and the dispatcher backs off until the model may be retried --
and the note it leaves says the model is downloading, not that the deployment
is misconfigured.

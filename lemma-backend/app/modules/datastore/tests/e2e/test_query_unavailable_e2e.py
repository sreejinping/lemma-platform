"""What direct querying answers when the deployment cannot support it.

`PS-DATA-021` promises the facility reports itself unavailable rather than
failing each query as though the person had written a bad one. The state is
real and not exotic: ad-hoc SQL runs as a dedicated Postgres role
(``datastore_query_role``, see ``readonly_query``), and a
managed Postgres that never provisioned it — or an app role without the power
to create it — leaves every query with nowhere to run.

It lives here rather than in the scenario suite because inducing it means
taking the role away, and a scenario cannot: the suite forbids mocking, and
dropping the role from a shared stack breaks every other scenario using it.
This is what the module e2e suite is for.

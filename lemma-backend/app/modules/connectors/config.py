"""Connector module configuration (Composio + connector runtime).

Field names are unchanged from the former monolithic ``Settings`` so environment
variables resolve identically (``COMPOSIO_API_KEY``, ``CONNECTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY``,
…). The ``schedule`` module also reads ``composio_*`` from here (an allowed
schedule→connector dependency).

System-default OAuth clients for native (Lemma-provider) connector connect
flows are resolved directly from the environment in
``infrastructure/adapters/env_system_oauth_config.py`` (env-presence drives
availability), kept SEPARATE from the login OAuth client in core config:
``CONNECTOR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`` / ``CONNECTOR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`` (a system
connector client typically needs different scopes than login), falling back to
the legacy shared ``GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`` / ``GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET``.

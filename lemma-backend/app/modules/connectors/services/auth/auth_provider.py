"""What an authentication scheme has to provide.

Every method takes the *install* rather than the connector. The connector is
shared catalog data; which client secret to present, which tenant an
installation is bound to, and whether the organization brought its own
credentials are all properties of one organization's install, and none of them
have anywhere to live on a catalog entry.

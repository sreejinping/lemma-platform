"""Turning whatever an executor raises into an honest domain error.

Split out of ``plumbing`` because the two halves point in opposite directions.
``plumbing`` builds a dispatcher, so it imports one; the dispatcher needs this
translation, so it imported ``plumbing`` back -- a cycle, deferred to call time
by an import inside a function and flagged as one by ``py/cyclic-import``.

Nothing here knows about a dispatcher. It reads an exception and decides whose
fault it describes, which is why the seam is here and not somewhere chosen to
satisfy the query.

"""What a chat surface may ask about the account it runs on.

Eight operations, not the 1,400-line `ConnectorService` plus two repositories
plus two mapped classes that `app/composition/surface_connectors.py` published.
The service was the worst of it -- handed whole, it let a surface reach
`connector_service.account_repository` and `connector_service.auth_config_repository`
and call whatever it liked -- but the ORM classes were not the earned exception
they looked like. `Account` was one `session.get` and one six-column select;
`AuthConfig` was a single `session.get` followed by four field reads. Neither
was a join, so neither is here: both became operations, and the surfaces module
no longer holds a `select()` against another module's table.

**The storage detail that had escaped.** `for_account` in
`agent_surfaces/services/credential_resolver.py` was reading the raw
`accounts.credentials` column *itself*, checking it for a `_encrypted` marker,
and filling gaps in the decrypted credentials from the plaintext half. Which
fields are stored in the clear, and how the encrypted ones are marked, is
connectors' business twice over -- it is the storage format, and getting the
test wrong hands out either nothing or a ciphertext. `account_with_secrets`
answers that here, once.

A submodule for the same reason as `retirement` beside it: these reach the
service, repository and model layers, and `contracts/__init__` is imported by
anything that wants any contract at all.

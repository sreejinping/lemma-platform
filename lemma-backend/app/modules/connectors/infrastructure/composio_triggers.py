"""Composio's trigger subscriptions, and the webhooks they deliver through.

The only place the Composio SDK's trigger surface is touched. Everything here
is a blocking network call made from an event loop, so all of it goes through
`run_blocking` on the `external_http` limiter -- shared with every other
Composio call, so a burst of webhooks cannot starve the CPU pool that chunking
and zipping depend on.

Failures are narrowed to the SDK's two exception roots rather than caught
wholesale. `composio.exceptions.ComposioError` is what the SDK raises on its
own; `composio_client.ComposioError` is the root of its HTTP client's
`APIError` tree -- status, connection and timeout. Between them they cover what
a provider call can do, and anything outside them is a bug here rather than a
provider that said no.

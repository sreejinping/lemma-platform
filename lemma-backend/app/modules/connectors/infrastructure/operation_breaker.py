"""Stop calling a connector operation that is already failing.

Connector execution reaches a third party, and the contract is deliberately
generous: the use case documents a 1-45 second call and holds no pooled
connection across it. Production's worst was 12.2 seconds. So a duration cap is
the wrong instrument — it would fail the slow operations that are working.

What is worth avoiding is the *other* shape: a provider that is down, where
every caller waits the full timeout to be told the same thing. A breaker turns
that from a slow failure into an immediate one, and stops us adding load to
something already struggling.

**Only infrastructure failures count.** A 422 is a malformed request, a 401 is a
stale credential, a 404 is a wrong operation name — all of them the caller's
problem, and none of them evidence the provider is unwell. Counting those would
let one badly-formed integration trip the breaker for everyone using the same
connector.

**State lives in Redis, not the process.** The api runs more than one replica,
and a breaker each replica learns separately is not a breaker — it is N
independent guesses, each needing its own full threshold before it helps. This
is also the codebase's standing rule: in-process caching is reserved for object
singletons, and this is shared state.

Half-open falls out of the TTLs rather than needing its own state machine. When
the breaker opens, the failure counter is left one short of the threshold with a
lifetime longer than the cooldown, so the *next* failure — whenever it comes —
re-opens immediately instead of waiting for another full run.

Being precise about what that is and is not: it is not a single-probe half-open.
Nothing serialises the calls that arrive the moment the open key expires, so a
busy operation lets a burst through at once rather than one. That is a
deliberate trade, not an oversight — admitting one caller at a time needs a lock
with an owner and a lease, which is a second thing that can fail, and the burst
costs one round of timeouts before the first failure re-opens the breaker for
everyone. What it buys is that a *recovered* provider comes back at full rate
immediately instead of ramping one probe per cooldown.

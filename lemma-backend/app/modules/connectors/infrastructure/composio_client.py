"""One Composio SDK client per process, per configuration.

``Composio(...)`` is not a cheap handle. It reads configuration, builds an httpx
client and imports the SDK's lazy namespaces; measured in a production pod it
takes **42-262 ms**, and it is synchronous, so all of that lands on the event
loop of whoever constructs it.

Four places built one. One of them — the webhook verifier — had already noticed
and cached it, with a comment measuring the same cost at a neighbouring call
site. The other three had not: a per-request auth provider, a per-request
operation gateway, and a schedule manager that built one on every trigger
create and delete. This module is that fix applied once instead of four times,
and it is what the ``process-lifetime-construction`` gate points at.

Keyed on the arguments that actually change behaviour rather than cached as a
single slot: the managed-files flag alters what the SDK does with responses, so
two clients that disagree about it are genuinely different clients. In practice
that is one entry, occasionally two.

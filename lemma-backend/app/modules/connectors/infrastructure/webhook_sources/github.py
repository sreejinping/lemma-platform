"""GitHub as a webhook source.

One App has one webhook URL and the installation decides which repositories it
covers, so everything arrives here: every event type, for every organization
that installed it. What separates them is the routing key, not the endpoint.

The key is `{source, installation_id, event}`. `installation_id` is what makes
it tenant-scoped -- without it a `pull_request` schedule in one organization
matches another organization's pull requests -- and the three together are
selective enough to reuse the existing GIN index on the schedule config with no
schema change. `repository_id` narrows further when the author scoped a
schedule to one repository, and `actions` filters here.

Repository *ids* rather than names throughout: a repository can be renamed or
transferred, and a schedule that stops firing when someone renames a repo is a
bug nobody connects to the rename.

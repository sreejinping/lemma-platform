"""Connectors' side of :class:`PodFileGatewayPort`, over datastore's file operations.

This was `app/composition/connector_pod_files.py`, on the argument that the
composition root is "the one place the two modules meet". It is not: connectors
declares the port, connectors is the only consumer, and datastore now publishes
the two operations behind it (`datastore/contracts/pod_files.py`). What was left
in the middle was an adapter that reached `datastore.api.dependencies` for a
service and then read three attributes off a `DatastoreFileEntity` through
`getattr(..., None)` -- a caller guessing at another module's schema, with the
guess-failure spelled the same as an honest absence.

The two operations arrive as constructor arguments so this can be exercised
without a database. Patching them on this module instead would install the
double inside the unit under test: the mapping below is the whole of what this
class does, and a stub in front of it certifies nothing.

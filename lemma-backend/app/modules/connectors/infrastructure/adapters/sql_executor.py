"""SQL connector executor — read-only queries against an external database.

An ``sql``-kind connector stores its connection config on the auth-config
(``connection_config``: dialect/host/port/database) and per-user secrets on the
account (``third_party_credentials``: username/password). Operations are a fixed
set — ``query`` / ``list_tables`` / ``describe_table`` — selected by the
``execution`` descriptor's ``op``.

Safety: ``query`` accepts only a single read-only SELECT-family statement
(validated with sqlglot, reusing the datastore's forbidden-node/allowed-root
rules), runs in a ``READ ONLY`` transaction with a ``statement_timeout``, and
caps returned rows. Engines are cached per connection and reused across calls.

    handled by comparing the secret against the cached entry in constant time

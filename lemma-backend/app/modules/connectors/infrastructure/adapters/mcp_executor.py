"""MCP connector executor — proxy operations to an external MCP server's tools.

An ``mcp``-kind connector stores the MCP server URL on the auth-config
(``connection_config.server_url``) and the bearer token on the account
(``third_party_credentials``). Each operation's ``execution`` descriptor names the
tool (``tool_name``); executing calls ``tools/call`` on the server and maps the
result back to JSON (or a ``BinaryContentResult`` for binary content blocks).

An install may also carry ``connection_config.session_setup``: calls replayed at
the start of every session, because a session here lasts exactly one tool call
and some servers gate their tools behind session-scoped state. See
``MCP_SESSION_SETUP_KEY``.

The MCP client factory is injectable so tests can drive an in-memory server.

        (OpenWeather's "HTTP 401"), or a raised SDK exception carrying an HTTP
        status. All three land here, because the classification decides real

        could return -- five times in 25 seconds. Each one was reported as
        "provider temporarily unavailable", which invited a retry that could
        never succeed, and the fifth opened the breaker on a provider that was
        healthy and answering in 3.4s. Seven subsequent calls were refused.

        unfamiliar it is; only a 5xx, or a failure with no status at all, says

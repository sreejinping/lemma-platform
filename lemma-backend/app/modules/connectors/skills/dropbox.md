# Dropbox

Dropbox is a cloud storage service for file syncing, sharing, and collaboration — used by individuals, teams, and businesses. Its APIs enable programmatic file management, member invitations, and metadata tagging.

**Auth config name:** `dropbox`

## Common Tasks

### Upload a file
Use when you need to store a new document, image, or any file up to 150 MiB in a user’s Dropbox.
```

```

### Share a file with someone
Use to give a specific person viewer, editor, or commenter access to a file by ID.
```

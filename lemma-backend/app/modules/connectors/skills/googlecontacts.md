## Common Tasks

### Create a new contact
Use when you need to add a person with their name, email, and phone number to the user’s Google Contacts.
```

```

### Retrieve a single contact
Use when you know the resource name and need the full profile (names, emails, phones) of a specific contact.
```
lemma connectors operations execute googlecontacts GOOGLECONTACTS_GET_PERSON -d '{"payload": {"resourceName": "people/c9876543210987654321", "personFields": "names,emailAddresses,phoneNumbers"}}'

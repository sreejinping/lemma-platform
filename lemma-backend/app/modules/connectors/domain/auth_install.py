"""One organization's install, resolved for an authentication decision.

Authentication used to be handed a :class:`ConnectorEntity` -- the *catalog*
entry -- with runtime-only fields ``model_copy``-ed onto it: a resolved
``oauth2_config`` for native installs, a ``composio_toolkit_slug`` for brokered
ones. That entity is shared, cached catalog data, so grafting per-install state
onto a copy of it made "which of these fields describe the connector and which
describe *this* org's install" unanswerable at a glance, and left no room at all
for the parts of an install that are neither: its ``config``, its
``config_source``, its id.

This is the install, stated once. It is deliberately separate from
:class:`~app.modules.connectors.domain.kinds.ResolvedInstall`, which serves
execution and discovery: that one must never carry a decrypted OAuth client
secret, and this one has no business carrying an executor's spec.

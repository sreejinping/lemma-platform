"""Connector-operation execution saga.

Mirrors ``FunctionUseCases``: built from a ``uow_factory`` + a per-phase service
builder so the DB/auth resolve phase runs inside a SHORT unit-of-work scope and
the external Composio/Lemma operation call runs with NO pooled DB connection
held. A request-scoped service/context dependency would otherwise pin one pooled
connection per in-flight connector call (every ``pod.connectors.execute(...)``
from a function routes through here), exhausting the pool under load.

"""Which failures are the provider's fault, and which ones the breaker counts.

And what a failure is allowed to say. A provider that refuses a request explains
it in its own sentence -- "invalid_scope", "repository not found", a JSON body
naming the field it disliked -- and a caller that reads a fixed "Connector
rejected the operation request." instead has nothing to act on, which for a
model means nothing to correct.


Two mirror-image bugs. For http/sql the map stopped at 422, so every provider
5xx fell through to the catch-all as our own 500 -- the breaker, whose whole
purpose is "a provider that is down, where every caller waits the full
timeout", could open on a refused connection but never on a provider answering
503 to everything. For MCP the opposite: an application-level tool error was
raised as an infrastructure error, so five bad-argument calls inside the window
disabled a healthy server for the whole organization, and the tool's
explanation was discarded by an error class that hardcodes its own message.

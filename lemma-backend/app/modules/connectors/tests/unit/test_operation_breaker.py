"""Stop calling a provider that is already failing — and only for its own faults.

Connector execution reaches a third party under a deliberately generous
contract: 1-45 seconds, no pooled connection held. Production's worst was 12.2s.
A duration cap would fail the slow calls that are working, so the instrument is
a breaker: when the provider is down, stop making every caller wait the full
timeout to learn the same thing.

The risk a breaker introduces is worse than the problem it solves if it trips on
the wrong thing. A 422 is a malformed request, a 401 a stale credential, a 404 a
wrong operation name — all the caller's fault. Counting those would let one
badly-formed integration disable a working connector for every other tenant.

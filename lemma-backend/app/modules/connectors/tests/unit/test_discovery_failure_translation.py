"""What a caller is told when discovery fails against a tenant's own server.

Installing an MCP server that wants a token answered HTTP 500 with a Python
traceback in the response body. Two separate causes, both here:

* `KindDispatcher.discover` bounded the call in time and translated nothing
  else, so an `httpx.HTTPStatusError` escaped raw. Execute had the translation;
  discovery, which reaches the same tenant server over the same network, did
  not.
* The translator then read that error as an outage. `HTTPStatusError` is an
  `HTTPError`, so it matched the transport branch before anything looked for a
  status -- and a 401 came back as "temporarily unavailable", inviting the retry
  that function's own docstring says not to invite.

The provider's text now travels as the provider wrote it, including the two
shapes that look like secrets. That is a decision, not an oversight: see the two
tests at the end of this file.

"""Unit tests for ConnectorOperationUseCases — the saga that releases the pooled
DB connection across the external connector/Composio operation call.

The key guarantee: the DB/auth resolve phase runs (and its short scope closes,
releasing the connection + committing any OAuth-token refresh) BEFORE the
external execute phase runs.

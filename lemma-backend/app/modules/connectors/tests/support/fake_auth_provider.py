"""One test double for the auth port, declared as a subclass rather than
monkeypatched onto a concrete class.

The reason is a real incident. Adding ``code_verifier`` to
``get_authorization_url`` left four doubles behind on the old signature, each
installed with ``monkeypatch.setattr(LemmaAuthProvider, ...)``. A plain
function replacing a method matches no interface, so nothing objected: the unit
suite stayed green and only an e2e run found it.

Subclassing alone does not fix that here -- ``pyproject.toml`` excludes
``app/**/tests/**`` and ``app/modules/test_support/**`` from basedpyright, so a
type error in a test file is never read by anything. What makes this safe is
that the double is *importable*, which lets ``test_auth_provider_conformance``
check its signatures against the port at run time, in the fast suite. Declaring
it as a subclass is what makes that check meaningful, and buys the editor
squiggle for whoever changes the port next.

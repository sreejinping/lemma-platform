"""Counting what an install exposes, without reading it.

The number behind "showing 10 of 340" is a catalog count plus the install's own
discovered set minus the operations both sides name -- and that last term was
computed by reading the whole catalog for the connector, JSONB schemas and all,
to lowercase its names into a Python set.

The count is only worth anything if it agrees with the listing, so that is what
is asserted: the number and the merged list, against the same data. A count
that is cheap and wrong is worse than the read it replaced.

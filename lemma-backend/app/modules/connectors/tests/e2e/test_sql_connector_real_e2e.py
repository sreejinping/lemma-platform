"""The SQL connector against a real PostgreSQL server.

The unit tests can only prove that sqlglot rejects a statement before we open a
connection. They cannot prove the thing that actually matters: that a write
which *slips past* the parser is still refused by the server, that
``statement_timeout`` really fires, or that an evicted engine really closes its
sockets. Those are properties of Postgres, not of our parsing, so they are
tested against Postgres.

The database under test is a second database on the same container the e2e stack
already runs, standing in for a customer's database. Nothing external is
involved, so this is hermetic and runs in CI alongside the other e2e tests.

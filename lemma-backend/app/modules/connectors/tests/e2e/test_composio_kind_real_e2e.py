"""The composio kind against the live Composio API.

Everything else in the connector suite talks to something we control. This talks
to Composio itself, because the parts most likely to break are the parts we do
not own: whether the SDK still returns what we parse, whether a real tool call
round-trips, and -- the reason this file exists -- whether a real file download
comes back as something the caller can actually use.

Gated on ``COMPOSIO_API_KEY`` and skipped without it, so CI is unaffected. The
connected account is resolved once and cached (see ``composio_account_cache``);
the first run opens a browser for consent when ``RUN_HUMAN_OAUTH=1``, and every
later run reuses it.

Run::

    # after connecting once
    pytest -m provider app/modules/connectors/tests/e2e/test_composio_kind_real_e2e.py -s

    # first time, or after revoking access

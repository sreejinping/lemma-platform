"""Identity module configuration.

Twenty-five settings that only `mod:identity` reads, moved off
`app/core/config.py`. Env var names are unchanged: no settings class in this
repo sets `env_prefix`, so pydantic-settings derives each name from the field
identically on whichever class holds it, and `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`,
`TELEGRAM_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` and the rest reach this class exactly as they reached
`Settings`. Nothing in lemma-stack, the desktop host pack, compose or the docs
needs touching.

Telegram's OIDC endpoints did not come with them -- see `TELEGRAM_OIDC_*` below.

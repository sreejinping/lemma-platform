"""Rules that guard who is in an organization, and on what terms.

An invitation may carry a pod as well as a role. Accepting it used to add the
member first and *then* look the pod up, so an invitation naming a pod that had
since been deleted half-applied in silence: the person joined the organization,
the pod grant was dropped, and nothing said so. Resolving first means an
acceptance that cannot be honoured whole is refused whole, with the invitation
still pending and the refusal naming the pod. See PS-ONB-021.

The last-owner guard lives here for the same reason: demotion and removal are
two doors onto one rule, and stating it once is what stops the second being
left unlocked -- which is how self-removal stranded organizations with no owner
at all. See PS-ONB-041.

Both live beside the service rather than inside it because
``organization_service`` is already over the file-size ratchet, and because
each is a question worth naming.

        grant, exactly as in ``get_id_by_email_insensitive``, and it is the
        *first* branch tried, so it decides before the filtered email path is
        reached.

        back out. The reasoning for adding it was sound in isolation -- a
        ``telegram_username`` is free text on a profile that nobody confirms, so
        it is a claim and not a proof, and it is the first branch tried. What
        the reasoning missed is where the claim is spent. This lookup answers
        "who is this sender", which decides routing and an access refusal; it
        does not decide whether a permanent binding may be written. That second

        `SurfaceIdentityResolutionService._cache_is_attested` already refuses a
        resolution a Telegram handle is the only support for.

        Requiring it here cost two things and bought neither back. It made this
        stricter than ``get_id_by_email_insensitive`` directly beside it, which
        does not ask -- so the same unverified person resolved by email and not
        by handle. And it turned a clear refusal into a loop: an unverified
        sender stopped resolving, so ordinary ingestion asked them to share a
        phone number instead of telling them how to get access, and chat signup
        then refuses them anyway because `active_chat_user` does require

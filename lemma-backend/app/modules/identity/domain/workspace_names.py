"""What a person's first organization and pod are called when nobody typed a name.

Ported from `lemma-harness/components/onboarding/account-onboarding-helpers.ts`,
which did all of this in TypeScript because signing up through the app was the
only way in. Chat surfaces onboard people who never load the app at all, and a
second copy of "what is this workspace called" would drift from the first inside
one release -- so this is the implementation, and the web onboarding is being
moved onto it rather than kept beside it.

The generated names are deterministic on the address, not random. Someone whose
first attempt half-failed and who tries again lands on the same name, instead of
collecting a second differently-named workspace; and a name in a support ticket
can be reproduced from the email that made it.

The hash is FNV-1a as JavaScript computes it -- 32-bit wrapping, `Math.imul`
semantics, an unsigned shift for the noun and a signed value for the adjective.
Kept bit-exact rather than merely similar, because the two implementations have
to agree on the name for the same person for as long as both exist.

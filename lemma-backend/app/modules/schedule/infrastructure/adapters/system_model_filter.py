"""`ScheduleEventFilter`, answered by the system model.

Schedule's own port, schedule's own implementation. This was
`app/composition/schedule_filter.py`, and nothing about it varied by
deployment: it built the one filter this backend has, out of the system model,
and the two handlers that need a `ScheduleProcessor` imported the application
root to get one. Same move as `datastore_table_policy.py` next door, for the
same reason.

What kept it in the root was that it assembled a model itself -- resolve the
system runtime, then read a snapshot, credentials and a fallback model name off
the result and hand all three to agent's model factory. That is agent's job, and
`agent/contracts/model_runtime.py` now does it in one call, so the only thing
schedule states here is its own ceiling.

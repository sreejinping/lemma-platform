"""The ceiling the schedule filter asks for, and the bound that backs it up.

``UsageLimits.count_tokens_before_request`` makes pydantic-ai call
``Model.count_tokens`` before the request. The base method raises
``NotImplementedError`` and OpenAI-compatible models do not override it, so
asking for it there fails every LLM-filtered datastore schedule.

Deciding that is not schedule's job and no longer happens here:
``resolve_system_runtime`` takes this module's ceiling and returns the part of
it the resolved model can genuinely honour, and
``test_token_precount_support.py`` in ``agent`` is where that reduction is
proved. What is schedule's, and is asserted below, is the ceiling itself and
the consequence of it being honoured late: when the pre-count is dropped,
``input_tokens_limit`` is only enforced *after* the provider has been called and
billed, so the prompt has to be bounded before it is sent.

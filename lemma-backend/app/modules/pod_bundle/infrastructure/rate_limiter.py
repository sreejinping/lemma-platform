"""Per-user daily rate limiting for pod-bundle export/import jobs.

Export and import kick off long-running worker jobs (archive assembly, sandbox
app builds, multi-resource apply). Without a cap a single account can enqueue
them without bound and starve the workers, so we count job *starts* per user per
UTC day in Redis and reject once the configured limit is hit.

Design notes:

- The counter is a plain ``INCR`` on a date-stamped key (``…:{YYYYMMDD}``) with a
  short TTL, so each UTC day gets its own self-expiring key — no cron cleanup and
  no stale reads across days. The same ``INCR``/``EXPIRE`` pattern the schedule
  circuit breaker uses (:mod:`app.modules.schedule.services.schedule_fire_store`).
- **Fails open**: a Redis blip must never block a legitimate export/import, so a
  Redis error *reading the counter* is logged and treated as "under the limit".
  The cap is an abuse guard, not a correctness invariant — and it fails open into
  a narrower gap than it looks: the job queue is Redis-backed too, so a Redis
  outage stops the enqueue whether or not this counter answered. Once the
  counter *has* answered, its verdict is enforced; only the read may fail open.
- The cap is per **user**. PS-PACK-013 promises a bound per **organization**,
  which this does not give: an organization with many members has no org-level
  bound at all. Closing that needs an org-level limit to configure, so the two
  are named apart here rather than the docstring claiming what the code does not
  do.
- The increment happens on the *accepted* path only (the caller invokes this after
  authorization, before enqueue), so a rejected over-limit attempt still counts —
  which is the desired behavior: hammering the endpoint keeps you rejected rather
  than resetting your quota.

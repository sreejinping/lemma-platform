"""Facts about one person's membership of one pod.

Replaces `app/composition/workflow_pod.py`, which published `PodMemberRepository`
so `workflow` could construct it. Both callers wanted the same single fact —
this person's pod-member id, or nothing — to check that a form's assignee is the
person submitting it. A repository was three layers more than the question.

`pod_name` is here for the same reason: `agent`'s context brief was reaching
`Pod` itself, through `app/composition/agent_context_models.py`, to select one
column.

**The three below answer identity**, which owns organization invitations and has
to put the invitee in the pod the invitation named. They replace
`app/composition/pod_identity.py`, which built two pod repositories and
`PodRoleService` so it could implement identity's `PodMembershipPort` from
outside both modules -- and in doing so held pod's own rule about what an
unrecognised role name means. Identity's adapter now calls these and types the
result as its own port; the `Protocol` is structural, so pod never names it.

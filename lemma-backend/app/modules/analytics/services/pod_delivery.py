"""Activation: the first time a pod produced an outcome that counts.

``pod.delivered`` is the metric the whole product-analytics design is named for,
and it is the one that cannot be read off a single domain event. A pod delivers
when **either**:

**(a) somebody other than its builder received a successful outcome.** A
completed agent run, workflow run or surface answer whose recipient is not the
pod's creator. This is what stops a builder poking their own pod from counting
as adoption.

**(b) an autonomous origin produced a successful outcome**, whoever owns it --
``SCHEDULE``, ``DATA_TRIGGER`` or ``CONNECTOR``, terminal status completed.

Branch (b) is load-bearing and easy to leave out. Without it a scheduled report
pod, owned and read by the person who built it, never activates -- and that is
the design doc's own canonical example of a pod delivering value. A definition
that scores it as churn is measuring chat, not the product.

Fires once per pod, ever. That fact is a marker on the pod's own row, claimed
through ``pod.contracts.delivery``: pod owns the write because pod owns the
column and the conditional ``UPDATE`` that makes the claim atomic. What the
marker *means* is here.

Not Redis alone: a flush or a failover would re-fire activation for every
established pod at once and corrupt the funnel irreversibly. Redis sits in front
as a negative cache, which is safe because a miss only ever costs a read.

# genuinely about every module at once, each runs at most once per pod for the
# life of the platform, and the alternative -- a contract call per module -- is
# five or seven round-trips to answer a question the database answers in one.

#   agents.pod_id, workflow_flows.pod_id, schedules.pod_id, apps.pod_id

# the cost of the exception. It is stated here so the next reader does not have
# to infer it from the SQL.

#: processed. Each source reaches the pod differently -- an agent run through its

#: directly -- which is why this is three subqueries rather than one.

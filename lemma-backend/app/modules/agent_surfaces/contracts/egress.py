"""What an agent run sends out to the chat surface it is answering on.

Six operations, replacing `app/composition/agent_surface_runtime.py`. That file
existed because `agent` importing `agent_surfaces` would have closed a loop; the
loop is cut (see `contracts/notifications.py`), so this is an ordinary contract
and can say what it takes and returns. Every signature on the shim was `object`
or `list[object]` -- not because the types were unknown, but because naming them
in the composition root would have put a third module's paths into `agent`'s
build. `agent/contracts` publishes `Conversation` and `DisplayResourceRequest`,
so they are named here.

The direction is one-way: `agent` decides what to send and this delivers it.
What a platform *is* -- the capability lookups and the prompt text derived from
them -- is `contracts/platforms.py`.

A submodule rather than `contracts/__init__`, which is a leaf: these reach the
service and adapter layers.

    personal data -- on the understanding that the code names the branch that
    refused. ``AGENT_SURFACE_VALIDATION_ERROR`` did not: a dozen branches raise
    it, so a pod silently getting no mailbox looked identical to a bad name or a
    mode mismatch, and telling them apart took a database and a code read.

    A conflict says "somebody else has the thing you asked for, take it up with
    them" -- that is `AgentSurfaceCredentialConflictError`, and it names the pod
    holding it so the UI can link there. This organisation conflicts with
    nobody: it asked for *a* number and the deployment has none left to give.
    There is no other party and nothing the caller can do differently, so the
    honest answer is that the service cannot serve the request right now and
    somebody has to buy more numbers.

    Exhaustion is a steady state rather than a failure. A pool is bought a
    number at a time and can sit fully allocated for weeks, reached entirely
    through ordinary success -- so it is not logged as degraded where it is
    detected. Only the caller knows whether it is failing a person's request,

"""The WhatsApp numbers a deployment owns, and which of them may be handed out.

A deployment used to have exactly one number, named in settings, and "the
WhatsApp credential" and "the WhatsApp number" were the same sentence. They are
not the same thing once there are several, so this names the number: what
addresses it (``phone_number_id``), what a person sees (``display_phone_number``)
and the per-number credentials it answers with.

Every credential field is optional and absent means *fall back to settings* --
which is what lets a one-number deployment keep working with no rows at all.
See ``migrations/versions/2026-09-21_whatsapp_number_pool_0039.py`` for why
``app_secret`` is here despite being per Meta *app* rather than per number.

Who *holds* a number is deliberately not here. The holder is the surface, on
``agent_surfaces.surface_identity_id``, scoped by ``organization_id``: a second
copy on this row would be two places that can disagree about who holds a scarce
thing. So this entity is inventory, not an allocation. Several organisations may
hold one number at the same time -- routing narrows on the sender first and uses
the number only as a further predicate -- so "held" is never exclusive
deployment-wide, only within an organisation.

Nor is there anything saying what a number is *for*. Every row is a number this
deployment owns and sends from, and they behave identically; the only question
the inventory answers about a row is whether allocation may still offer it,
which is ``status``.

    because ``surface_type`` and ``event_mode`` are free ``String`` columns
    whose enums lost members, so a stored row can legitimately name something
    this code no longer knows -- and one such row must not take a whole page
    with it. Here ``status`` is held to its members by a CHECK constraint in the
    database, so an unknown value is not a configuration somebody chose and
    outlived; it is corruption or a migration that was not run, and
    ``ValueError`` from the enum is the right, loud answer. If a member is ever
    retired, that reasoning changes and this is where the tolerance belongs.

"""Block Kit construction for the Slack surface.

Slack's ``markdown`` block (Feb 2025) renders standard Markdown natively —
headings, tables, lists, code fences, links, block quotes, task lists. That
makes it the correct container for model-authored text: the agent writes normal
Markdown and Slack renders it, instead of the agent being coached to hand-write
legacy ``mrkdwn`` and getting it wrong whenever it slipped.

The one hard constraint is a *cumulative* 12,000-character cap across every
markdown block in a single payload, which is why long answers are chunked into
separate messages rather than separate blocks in one message.

        Returning ``None`` drops the event, and for an email we cannot read that
        is the right failure: the alternative is starting an agent run whose
        user message is the empty string, which is what shipped and what made
        every inbound email look like the agent ignoring people.

        The fetch is **not** unconditional, and that is the point. When the
        webhook already carries the body, asking the API for it again puts a
        working message behind a call that can fail — and it did: a Resend key
        restricted to sending answers ``GET /emails/receiving`` with 401, so a
        reply we had already been handed in full was dropped and retried eight
        times while the person who sent it heard nothing.

        So: keep what arrived, use the fetch to fill what is missing, and only
        fail when there is nothing to work with.

        The fetch also re-derives the thread root from ``References``. When the
        webhook carries headers that is already done by the parser; when it does
        not, this is the only way a reply rejoins its conversation instead of
        opening a new one.

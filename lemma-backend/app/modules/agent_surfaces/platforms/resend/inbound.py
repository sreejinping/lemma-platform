"""Flattening Resend's ``email.received`` webhook for the inbound parser.

Lives beside the Resend parser rather than in the shared webhook controller
because it encodes one provider's envelope, and the thing most worth recording
about that envelope is what it leaves out: **no body, no headers** beyond
``message_id``. Resend documents that you must call the Received Emails API for
the content, which is why ``email_id`` below is the load-bearing field — without
it there is nothing to fetch with, and the agent sees an empty message.

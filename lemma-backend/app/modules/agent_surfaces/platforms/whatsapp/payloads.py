"""Building the JSON bodies WhatsApp's Cloud API expects.

Pure construction: what an outbound message, an interactive reply-button block,
a list picker, a CTA-URL card and a media caption look like on the wire, and how
each of them is kept inside Meta's length limits. Split from
:mod:`service` — which owns credentials, HTTP and the API calls — because it is
the half with no I/O in it and the half worth reading on its own.

Every string that reaches these builders is model-authored, so every one of them
goes through :mod:`text_format` on the way in. That is not decoration: the agent
writes Markdown, WhatsApp renders a different and much smaller syntax, and an
untranslated string arrives on the phone as literal asterisks. Truncation runs
*after* translation and is followed by a re-balance, because a cut can land in
the middle of a pair and leave the marker this module exists to prevent.

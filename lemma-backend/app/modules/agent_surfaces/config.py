"""Agent surfaces module configuration (native messaging platforms).

Field names are unchanged from the former monolithic ``Settings`` so the
environment variables resolve identically (``SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET``,
``TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN``, ``MICROSOFT_BOT_APP_ID``, ``SURFACE_*``, …).

Note: ``microsoft_tenant_id`` and ``microsoft_client_*`` are the *login* OAuth

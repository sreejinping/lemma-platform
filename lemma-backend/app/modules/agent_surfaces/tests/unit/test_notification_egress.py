"""Getting a notification onto a platform, and leaving a way back.

Everything here is about the half of delivery that had no tests at all, which
is why it shipped calling two ingress methods that were never written. The
existing suites all run in a pod with no active surface, so ``deliver()``
returns before reaching any of this and both ``AttributeError``s were invisible.

The doubles are built with ``create_autospec`` on purpose. A bare ``Mock()``
answers any attribute you ask it for, which reproduces exactly the blind spot
under test: it would have passed happily against a method that did not exist.

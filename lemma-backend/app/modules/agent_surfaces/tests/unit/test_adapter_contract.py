"""The adapter contract: what shared code may call on any platform.

`AppEventHandler` and the ingress service reach for an adapter by
platform and call methods on whatever comes back. Nothing checked that every
adapter could answer those calls, so #303 added `parse_channel_setup` to Slack
alone and every Telegram and WhatsApp webhook raised `AttributeError` in the
worker — retried, dead-lettered, and the message reached nobody.

The rule these tests enforce: a method one adapter exposes publicly is part of
the contract and belongs on `BaseSurfaceAdapter`, with a default for platforms
that cannot do it. Anything genuinely private to one platform is underscored
and shared code cannot reach it.

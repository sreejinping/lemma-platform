"""The per-number WhatsApp callback URL, where the path is the discriminator.

Meta's GET handshake carries ``hub.mode``, ``hub.challenge`` and
``hub.verify_token`` and nothing that says *which number* is being verified, so
on one shared callback URL there is nothing to select a token by. These check
the thing that replaces it: the number is in the path, every credential is
chosen from the path, and the body is never allowed to pick the key it will be
checked against.

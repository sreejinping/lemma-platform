"""A typed approval reply on a surface: transport plumbing around the agent's reading of it.

What a reply *means* is the agent's (`agent/tests/unit/test_interaction_reply.py`
pins the vocabulary). What is pinned here is what the surface does with that
answer: consume the message and record the decision, or -- the case these tests
exist for -- fall through as an ordinary message. A "not a decision" reply used
to be folded into DENY, which cancelled the action *and* discarded what the

"""A message that reached nobody must say so, at a level the deployment keeps.

Every path here failed silently in production and none of it was a mystery in
the code -- it was `logger.debug`, and the deployment runs `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`,
which drops `debug` before formatting. So a WhatsApp send that Meta rejected,
and a run whose answer was never delivered, both looked exactly like success.

`caplog` is set to DEBUG here on purpose: these assert the *level* each call was
made at, which is the whole of what was wrong.

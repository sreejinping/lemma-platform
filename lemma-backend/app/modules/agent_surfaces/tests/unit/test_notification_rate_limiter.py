"""Bounding what an agent can send, in the two ways it can run away.

The limiter had no tests at all — which is how it came to be modelled in #264
and left unenforced until #316. Both windows are covered here, including the
Redis-is-down behaviour, because "fails open" is a decision that should break a
test if someone quietly reverses it.

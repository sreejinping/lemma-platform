"""What the planner actually does with the two hot surface reads.

Every index on these tables is now named by the query that needs it, in a
comment beside its declaration. A comment is a claim, and this is the check:
`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, FORMAT JSON)` the two reads that run on every inbound
message and assert the shape of the plan.

Plan shape rather than statement counts, and rather than timings. A statement
count cannot tell a constant-cost read from one that scans a table growing per
thread -- the count is 1 either way, which is exactly the regression the
continuity index exists to end. Timings on a laptop under Docker measure the
laptop. What does not lie is which node the planner chose, and whether the rows
it touched move when rows are added that the query is not for.

Two claims, one per index:

``ix_agent_surface_link_thread_continuity``
    `find_surface_id_for_external_thread` is the only link read not scoped to a
    surface -- it exists to find which surface a returning chat already lives
    on. It matched the standalone `platform` btree before, so every inbound
    message filtered and sorted a table that grows per thread across the whole
    deployment.

``ix_agent_surface_routing``
    Every routing read leads with `(surface_type, status)` and takes the result
    in `(created_at, id)` order, which is the documented tiebreak when a sender
    resolves to several candidates. Carrying the sort columns means the ordered
    index scan is the answer, with no sort node.

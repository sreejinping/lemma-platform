"""A pool of numbers, and the two answers it has to change.

One WhatsApp number was a deployment-wide constant: every surface sent from it,
every message arrived on it, and "the WhatsApp credential" and "the WhatsApp
number" were the same sentence. Splitting them changes exactly two answers, and
everything else in the module is supposed to be untouched.

**What a surface sends as.** `native_credentials` reads settings and takes a
`surface` it ignores for WhatsApp, so every surface answered with the same
token. A surface holding a pooled number must answer with *that* number's.

**Which surface a message is for.** The arriving number now narrows candidates
-- beside the sender's pods, never instead of them, because a pooled number may
be held by several organisations and so names a number rather than a customer.

The third thing these pin is the half that must *not* change: a deployment with
no pool rows, and a surface holding no number, both behave exactly as before.
That is what lets this ship without a migration of behaviour.

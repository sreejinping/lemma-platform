"""Progress-streaming tool-coverage matrix: tool activity as a live message.

Which platforms belong here is decided by ``ProgressStyle`` on the platform
capability (see ``progress_display.py``), and the cells this file does not cover
are the styles that are not a live message:

- **WhatsApp** (``POST``) has no message-edit API, so it cannot appear in a
  matrix about edits. It is not silent — it posts the agent's plan as its own
  message, rationed — but that path is driven by plan changes rather than by
  per-tool comments, and is covered in ``tests/unit/test_progress_observer.py``.
- **Email** (``NONE``) gets one composed reply, never a stream — Gmail/Outlook/
  Resend recipients would find a live-editing inbox message bizarre.

Each scripted tool call carries a ``comment`` (nested under ``request``, since
every platform tool takes a single ``request: Model`` parameter and no such
model uses ``extra="forbid"`` — see ``script_progress``'s docstring). The
progress observer reads that comment straight off the persisted (pre-tool-
execution) event to drive the live status text, independent of whatever the
wrapped tool itself returns.

The journey is one sentence on every platform: say something, and watch the
work happen before the answer arrives. What differs is the shape the platform
gives that, and *that* is the subject here — so the staging is shared through
`stage_surface` and the assertions are deliberately not. Telegram and Teams
both edit a message in place and share a case; Slack opens a native stream,
which is a different thing and keeps its own.

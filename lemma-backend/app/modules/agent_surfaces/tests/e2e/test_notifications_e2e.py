"""E2E for notifications: the full recipient lifecycle over the real HTTP API,
against a real database.

The claim under test is the one the whole feature rests on — *a notification
owns the ask from creation until it resolves, and it resolves exactly once*. So
these exercise the illegal moves as hard as the legal ones: answering twice,
dismissing something that owes an answer, free-texting a workflow form. Each is
what a second browser tab, a retried worker job, or an impatient double-click
will actually attempt.

Delivery is asserted the same way. ``UNDELIVERABLE`` is a *success* here — the
pod has no surface the recipient has ever used, so no chat app could carry it,
and the point is that the notification exists and the inbox has it regardless.

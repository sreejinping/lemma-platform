"""The shared bot's fan-in, and what it costs to answer one message.

A platform-wide webhook arrives for the whole deployment at once: WhatsApp Cloud
API and the Telegram shared bot deliver every sender's message to one endpoint,
and the surface it belongs to is decided per sender. The candidate query for
that is every system-credential surface of the platform there is -- one per
provisioned person -- read and hydrated on the way to picking the one or two the
sender can actually use. Measured on this harness at 200 extra provisioned
users, it went from 1 row to 201: strictly linear in how many people have signed
up, on the path every message takes.

These pin the narrowing that fixed it *and* the answers it must not change.

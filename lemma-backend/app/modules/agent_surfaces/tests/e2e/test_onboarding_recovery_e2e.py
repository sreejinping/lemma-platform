"""What signup does when it cannot go forward, and what it says when it does.

Four states a person could be left in, all of them silent or permanent, none of
them visible from inside the conversation:

* a refusal `_complete` had no answer for, left on the step that produced it, so
  every later message was refused in the same words with no exit;
* a revoked platform identity the flow invited back through signup and then
  refused to finish, because "not this account's" and "nobody's" were read as
  the same thing;
* success, which said nothing at all and relied on a replay that can
  dead-letter to be the only sign anything had happened;
* a verified person waiting on an administrator, whose row the purge deleted in
  about a day -- the one state whose entire purpose is to outlast a human.

The shared bot is the setting throughout because it is the one that needs no
installation to exist: a number carries the message without belonging to any
workspace, which is exactly the stranger case signup is for.

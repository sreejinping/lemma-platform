"""Someone the system recognises, with nowhere yet to talk.

A verified identity and nowhere for the message to go used to fall through to
ordinary ingestion, which answered by telling a person who already has an
account to go and open the website. These drive the step that replaced that:
the offer, the answer, and the two ways an answer can be wrong.

The premise is deliberately the **shared bot**. On a company installation,
having a transport *is* having a candidate -- the surface the message arrived
through is the one routing would pick -- so "recognised, nothing to route to"
is not a state that installation can reach for one of its own members. The
shared number can: it carries the message without belonging to any workspace,
so a recognised sender with no system-credential surface they can reach has
genuinely nowhere to go. The last test here pins the other half, that somebody
routing *can* place is never interrupted by the question.

The binding key is read back from the row the first message creates rather than
computed here. It is a hash of platform, tenant, installation and actor, and a
test that recomputed it would keep passing after the real one changed shape.

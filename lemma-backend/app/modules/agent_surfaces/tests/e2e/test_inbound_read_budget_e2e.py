"""What one inbound message costs the database, per table.

A budget, not a plan. The plan tests next door ask whether *one* read touches the
right number of rows; this asks how many reads there are at all, because the
expensive shape here is not a bad index -- it is the same question asked four
times by four pieces of code that each resolved it for themselves.

Only this module's own tables are budgeted. An inbound message issues around 80
statements end to end, and about 50 of those belong to the agent run it starts
-- conversations, messages, runs, usage. Budgeting those here would make this
test fail for changes in a module it knows nothing about, which is how a gate
gets deleted rather than fixed.

The ceilings are the measured counts plus one. One is enough to absorb an
ordinary edit and not enough to hide a second copy of a question, which is the
regression this exists to catch. Raising one means writing down which question
is now being asked twice and why that is right.

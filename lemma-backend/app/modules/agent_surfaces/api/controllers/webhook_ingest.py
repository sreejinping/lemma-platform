"""Turning a raw platform webhook into an event, before any route sees it.

Signature checks, payload decoding, and the per-platform special cases that have
to happen inside the HTTP request: a Resend catch-all address resolved to a
surface, a WhatsApp verification code that is identity traffic rather than a
message, and a Slack modal whose ``trigger_id`` expires before a worker could
ever reach it.

One table, `agent_surface_conversation_links`, and the three questions asked of
it: which conversation is this exact chat, which surface does a returning chat
already live on, and which thread is this person's on this surface.

Its own file because the directory's unit is one repository per table --
`external_user_repository`, `notification_repository` -- and this had been
sharing `surface_repository.py` with the installations repository, which is a
different table answering different questions. The two share nothing but

        Used when a notification opens a fresh conversation on a cold thread.
        Deliberately narrow next to ``update_conversation``: it leaves
        ``last_event``, ``last_message_id`` and ``last_inbound_at`` untouched, so
        the surface still knows when the person last spoke and the DM reset rule
        still works.

        Compare-and-set on ``expected_conversation_id``: an inbound arriving
        between our read and this write has already repointed the link, and
        stealing it back would split one thread across two conversations. Losing
        that race returns None and the caller delivers into the conversation the
        inbound created.

        ``routed_agent_id`` is the agent the new conversation was opened under.
        The link carries the agent its conversation belongs to, and the reply is
        routed to the surface's *current* agent: left at whatever the previous
        conversation had, the two disagree for a surface whose agent was changed
        since, and the reply is cut into a fresh conversation the notification
        never reached.

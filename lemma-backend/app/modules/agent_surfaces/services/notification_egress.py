"""Everything between "we picked a channel" and "the platform has it".

Split out of ``notification_service`` so that file stays under the size ceiling,
but the seam is a real one rather than a filing convenience: this half talks to
surfaces and conversations, the other half owns notification *state* — creation,
response, expiry — and never needs to know how a message physically leaves.

The collaborator is held as :class:`SurfaceNotificationEgressPort`, not as an
untyped kwarg. That is not decoration. Both of the ``AttributeError`` crashes
this module was extracted to fix were calls to ingress methods that had never
been written, and neither mypy nor any test could see them because the
attribute was untyped and every test ran in a pod with no surface, where
delivery returns before reaching this code at all.

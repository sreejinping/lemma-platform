"""Which of the deployment's surfaces an inbound event could be for.

Two narrowings, and they run in that order because each is cheaper than the one
after it. `fan_in_candidates` reduces a shared bot's whole fan-in to the pods
the sender actually belongs to; `admitted_surfaces` then keeps the ones whose
own rules say they should act on this event.

Functions taking their collaborators rather than an object of their own: each
needs one or two of them and calls back into neither, which is the same shape as
`surface_bulk_teardown` and `onboarding_replies`, and for the same reason. They
were methods on `SurfaceInboundMixin`, where they read `self.router`,
`self.surface_repository` and `self.conversation_link_repository` off a
namespace that never declared them -- eleven of that file's baselined type
errors were exactly that, and they are gone now that the names arrive as
arguments.

    """The shared bot's fan-in, narrowed to the pods the sender is in.

    The fan-in is every system-credential surface of the platform in the
    deployment -- one per provisioned person -- read and hydrated on the way
    to picking the handful this sender can use. Narrowing it looks circular,
    because selection needs the sender and the sender was resolved from
    `candidates[0]`'s credentials. It is not, and the reason changed when
    WhatsApp numbers became a pool.

    It *used* to be that every candidate is a system-credential surface and
    `native_credentials` answers those from settings -- the same values
    whichever row asks. That is no longer true: a pooled number carries its
    own access token, so which row asks now decides what comes back. The
    ordering survives because sender resolution needs no credentials at all.
    `WhatsAppPlatformService.fetch_sender_profile` reads `sender_phone` and
    `sender_display_name` straight off the parsed webhook and makes no API
    call, so there is nothing for a token to authorise. The installation id
    is not needed either -- `resolve` consults it only for Slack and Teams,
    and neither has a shared bot.

    The arriving number then narrows beside the sender's pods rather than
    instead of them. It has to be beside: a pooled number may be held by
    several organisations, so on its own it names a number and not a
    customer.

    An unknown sender, or one who belongs to none of these pods, gets no
    candidates from here and the caller reads the fan-in unnarrowed. That is
    what keeps the answer identical rather than merely cheaper: selection
    falls back to the thread's existing surface for a non-member, and that
    surface is how ordinary ingestion tells them they have no access to the
    pod their conversation is in.

    Everything `allows_inbound_event` can decide on its own is decided
    first, and for almost every message that is the whole answer: a DM, an
    @mention, a channel the surface is not connected to. Only one case is
    left over, and only there is anything read.

    That case is a reply inside a channel thread with no mention in it.
    `is_thread_reply` comes from the payload -- Teams' `replyToId`, Slack's
    `thread_ts` -- so it says "this is a reply", never "this is a reply to
    *us*". Admitting on it alone meant every threaded reply by a pod member,
    anywhere in a connected channel, started an agent run: two colleagues
    talking under somebody else's message paid for a model call each time,
    and the run began with no conversation to continue.

    The link answers it, on the same key routing continues a conversation
    with -- thread *and* sender. That equivalence is the point rather than a
    convenience: if there is no link, `_route_to_surface` would not have
    continued anything either, it would have opened a fresh conversation
    with no history, which is precisely the run that should not happen. If
    there is one, the reply belongs to a conversation already under way and
    goes through exactly as before.

    The read is on the narrow path only, and it replaces an agent run rather
    than adding to one -- so the case that costs a query is the case that
    used to cost a model call.

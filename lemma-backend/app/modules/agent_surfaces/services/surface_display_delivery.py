"""Self-contained surface delivery for the ``display_resource`` tool.

The ``display_resource`` tool delivers a resource to a third-party chat surface
itself (rather than the run observer re-parsing the event stream). It calls
``deliver_display_resource_to_surface`` with the validated request; this module
owns the unit-of-work + egress construction so the tool needs no
surface-specific wiring on its context.

Works uniformly for both agent harnesses: the in-process LEMMA harness and the
remote harness (whose MCP tool calls execute in the backend) both reach this the
same way — each call opens its own short uow. Credentials are resolved by the
ingress service per call; ``display_resource`` is infrequent so this is not a hot
path.

Email surfaces (Gmail/Outlook) are intentionally NOT delivered here — their
resources are accumulated by the run observer into a single composed reply.

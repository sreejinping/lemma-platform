"""Long-polling Telegram for one bot, when no webhook can be registered.

Telegram allows a single consumer per bot token, so this leases the bot, polls
getUpdates in a loop, and gives up only after a grace period of 409s -- long
enough for a handover between two workers, short enough that a bot genuinely
owned elsewhere is not held forever.

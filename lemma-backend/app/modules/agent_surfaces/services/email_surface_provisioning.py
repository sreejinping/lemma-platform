"""Giving a surface its inbound address — the one place that does it.

There were three ways in, and they disagreed. Agent creation minted the readable
``{agent}.{pod}@domain`` with insert-and-retry; notification delivery minted
``pod-{hex}@domain`` through a different function; and anything arriving through
the API or a bundle import got the ``pod-{hex}`` form by default, from a
fallback inside ``create_surface`` that existed precisely so a caller need not
know about any of this. So the address a person saw depended on which door their
surface came through, only one of those doors produced something typeable, and
two of them skipped ``RESERVED_LOCAL_PARTS`` entirely — which is how a pod named
"Postmaster" could have taken ``postmaster@`` on a shared domain.

Every caller now comes here:

- ``create_agent`` and ``create_pod`` provision eagerly, so an address exists
  before anyone can write to the agent or the pod. Nobody can email something
  whose mailbox is conditional on it having sent a message first.
- Notification delivery provisions lazily, for an agent that turns out to have
  no way to reach anyone — one that predates per-agent mailboxes.
- The surfaces API and the bundle applier come through
  :func:`create_surface_on_minted_address`, which is the same allocation with
  the caller's own name, config and credentials.

``create_surface`` no longer has a fallback to reach for: a Resend surface
without an address is now an error, so a fourth door cannot open quietly.

``agent_id=None`` is the pod assistant. That is not "unset": a surface with no
agent of its own is exactly what ``surfaces_for_agent`` looks for on its behalf,
so the pod's own mailbox is what the assistant sends from.

    Raises rather than degrading. These callers are answering a request that
    said "connect this surface": handing back a surface with an address nobody
    can receive on would be a worse answer than a refusal.

    holds one mailbox per agent, and both already exist before anyone asks: the

    said it does ("Every agent already has one... reads as 'back on', not

    distinct thing, and the bundle applier always does — its upsert is keyed on
    that name so a bundle round-trips. Adopting under a name the caller chose
    would silently rewrite the wrong surface.

    Takes the unit of work rather than its session because the minting branch

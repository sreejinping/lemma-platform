"""Resolves the credentials a platform adapter needs for a surface.

Single home for the account-credential merging rules shared by the ingress
pipeline and the agent tool factory:

- Accounts whose apps manage their own long-lived secrets (bot tokens etc.)
  use stored credentials as-is; OAuth-backed apps go through the connector
  service refresh flow with a stored-credential fallback.
- Non-secret context keys (scopes, raw_response, user_data) are merged back in
  because platform adapters read identity data from them.
- WhatsApp/Telegram can run on system credentials from environment settings

        currency of this module is `dict[str, Any]`, honestly so -- provider
        payloads are genuinely shapeless -- but a pooled number's four fields
        are all strings, and taking the looser type here would have added two
        untyped escapes to buy nothing.

        `native_credentials` is a pure function over settings and stays that
        way: it is called from synchronous code and from paths with no unit of
        work, and giving it a database read would make every one of those a lie.
        The pool read belongs here instead, where there is a `uow` and where the
        result is resolved once per delivery.

        Absent overrides leave the settings answer standing, which is what makes
        a single-number deployment need no rows.

        ``arrived_on`` is the number the message being answered came in on, and
        it is what makes a pooled number work for a surface that holds none.
        `_ensure_shared_surface` mints the shared-line surface every chat signup
        lands on, and deliberately leaves `surface_identity_id` NULL -- several
        personal pods in one organization ride one line, and stamping the number
        would put them under `uq_agent_org_whatsapp_number` and refuse the
        second person to sign up. So the surface cannot say which number to
        answer from, and without this the settings number answered every one of
        them: somebody who wrote to a pooled number got a reply from a different
        number, and if that number sits under another WABA the token is not even
        authorised to send as it.

        The surface still wins where it has an answer. A deliberately allocated
        number is a property of the surface and holds for messages it starts,
        which have no inbound event to have arrived on at all.

        ``platform`` stands in for the surface when there is none: the worker
        acting on an inbound message holds only the run's context, and the
        number it arrived on is still the one whose token may mark it read.

"""The agent's plan, read off a ``write_todos`` call and drawn for a surface.

The plan already exists — ``write_todos`` keeps a checklist in conversation
metadata and the agent ticks items off as it goes — but on a surface it was
invisible. Every tool call reduces to one status string, so a plan of five steps
reached the person as ``Using write_todos``: the single most informative thing
the agent produces, rendered as the least informative line it could be.

That matters most exactly where it was worst. On a long WhatsApp or Telegram run
the person has no other window into what is happening, so "which of the five
steps are done" is the whole answer to "is this still working". Here the
checklist is parsed back out of the tool's own return value and drawn as a
checklist.

The drawing is deliberately emoji and plain text — no Markdown. It cannot
unbalance a delimiter or need per-platform escaping on the way out.

It is drawn two ways, because a surface either has room for a checklist or it
does not. WhatsApp and Teams get the checklist. Telegram's live update is a
``tg-thinking`` chip whose HTML collapses newlines, so the checklist arrived
there as one run-on sentence with the marks stranded between the words — five
lines of structure flattened into something that read like a fault. What fits a
chip is one line, and :func:`render_plan_line` draws it: how far along the run
is, and the step it is on.

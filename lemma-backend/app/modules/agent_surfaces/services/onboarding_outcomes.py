"""The three ways a signup ends without an account at the other side.

Cancelled because they asked, expired because nobody came back, refused because
it cannot be finished. Separated from `ChatOnboardingCoordinator` because they
are one thing said three ways, and saying it three times in the middle of the
state machine is what let `_refused` go missing in the first place -- a refusal
that replied and changed nothing, so the next message re-entered the same branch
and was refused in the same words, with no exit and nothing logged.

All three do exactly the same thing to the row: drop the held message, set a
terminal step, and stamp `handed_off_at` so the next message goes through
`recognize_sender` and starts afresh. That is `_end_with`, and having it in one
place is the point -- the bug was one of the three not doing it.

An object with a constructor rather than free functions: three collaborators,
all read by every method.

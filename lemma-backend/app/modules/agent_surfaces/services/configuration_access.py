"""Who may configure a surface from inside the chat app, and which agents.

One question, asked of the same collaborators: given a webhook and the platform
account that sent it, which surfaces is that person allowed to point at an
agent, and which agents may they choose?

Its own object rather than a base class of `AppEventHandler`, because it has no
edge back: nothing here opens a modal, publishes an app home or answers a
lifecycle event. It was a mixin only so that a service composed of eight of them
could reach it, which is also why every method is still spelled with a leading
underscore -- renaming them is a change of its own.

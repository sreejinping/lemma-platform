"""Telling a person something, durably, wherever they actually are.

The order of operations is the design, and it is deliberately unusual: the row
is written **before** the send is attempted. If the platform call fails the
person still has the notification in Lemma and the asker can still see what it
said. The reverse order puts a message on someone's phone that the pod has no
record of — and a reply to it arrives against nothing.

What this service is *not*: a wait. It never blocks the caller and never
resolves anything back into the calling run. Resolution happens later, in the
recipient's own thread, under the recipient's own authority.

    that distinction is a phishing primitive.

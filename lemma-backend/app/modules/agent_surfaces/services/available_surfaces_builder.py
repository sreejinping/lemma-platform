"""Builds the read-only "available surfaces" catalog for the frontend.

Joins the canonical surface->connector registry (``SURFACE_CONNECTOR_BINDINGS``)
with the connector catalog and the platform's system-credential availability, so
the frontend can render the setup UI and orchestrate account connection
generically — and adding a new surface (e.g. Discord) is a backend-only change,
picked up automatically by iterating the registry.

Kept out of ``AgentSurfaceService`` on purpose: that service doesn't hold a
connector service, and this is a pure catalog join with no surface state. The
controller injects the connector service and calls this builder directly.

"""Driving a surface's live message while a run is in flight.

These five are the conversation-level face of a platform's *editable message*
API -- open a live message, write into it, close it with the answer, dispose of
it, show a typing bubble. That is a different adapter API from the one
:class:`SurfaceEgress` speaks, which is ``deliver(envelope)``: an envelope is a
thing a person receives, and everything here edits something they are already
looking at. Nothing here builds an envelope, and nothing in
:class:`SurfaceEgress` edits a live message, which is why they are two objects
over one :class:`SurfaceDelivery` rather than one object with two halves.

Stateless on purpose: the run owns the progress handle and passes it in. Every
method here is best-effort -- a dropped progress edit must never take down a
run, and the answer still lands through the egress path.

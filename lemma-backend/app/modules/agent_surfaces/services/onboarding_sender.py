"""Who is this sender, and is there anything to start for them?

Split from the coordinator because it is a different question from the one the
coordinator asks. The coordinator runs a conversation; this decides whether
there is a conversation to run -- whether the sender is already somebody, is
already talking to their own assistant, or is a stranger a pending signup has to
be opened for. The file was also at the architecture ratchet's per-file ceiling,
and this is the half that comes away cleanly.

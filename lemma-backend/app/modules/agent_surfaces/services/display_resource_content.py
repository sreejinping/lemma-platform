"""Reading what a displayed resource actually contains, for the surface.

The card the render plan builds knows only what the agent typed into the tool
call: a path, a table name, a filter. That is enough for a link and not enough
for a message. A person looking at their phone wants the file's size before
deciding to open it and the table's first rows instead of a promise of rows, so
this module fetches those — under the conversation owner's own authorization,
never the pod's — and hands back something the plan can carry.

It also owns getting a pod file onto the surface, because the two are the same
read: the entity that says whether the file fits is the entity whose name and
size describe it when it does not.

**Enrichment may not fail the send.** The table preview and a PDF's page image
are extras; the card, and the message behind it, must still go out when a table
cannot be read or a document will not rasterize. That promise is kept in one
place -- :func:`_best_effort` -- rather than by a ``try`` around each caller.
The file itself is the opposite: it is the message, so a file that cannot be
read is reported (``PodFileDelivery.unreadable``) instead of being replaced by a
card that pretends it was shown.

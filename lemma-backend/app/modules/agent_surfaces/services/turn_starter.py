"""Starting the agent's turn on what arrived, in short scopes around long I/O.

The worker task `process_surface_message` is the only caller, and `execute_chat`
is the only method it calls. That is why this is its own object: the ingress
service took *either* a unit of work *or* a factory, and in factory mode seven
collaborators were `None` and about forty of its ninety-two methods would have
raised `AttributeError`. One signature produced two different objects, and it
survived because exactly one caller used the second one for exactly one method.

So the second one is this, and the constructor says what it is: a factory, an
adapter registry, file ingest, and the dedup store. There is nothing here that
holds a connection, because that is the whole point of the shape --
`start_agent_chat` runs platform API calls, file ingestion and voice
transcription, and only then opens a short scope to write. What it writes with
lives in `surface_inbound_message` as free functions over a unit of work, which
is what those became once nothing needed them to be methods on a namespace.

    **There is no setting.** There used to be one, defaulting to "believe an
    unauthenticated ``From:``", on the reasoning that not every provider writes
    ``Authentication-Results`` and refusing blind would stop resolving every
    inbound sender. That reasoning rested on a question nobody had asked the
    provider: 20 of 20 real inbound messages carry the header, written by
    ``amazonses.com``, because Resend receives through SES. So the config was
    protecting against something that does not happen, at the price of leaving
    account takeover a single environment variable away -- and a flag whose safe
    value is the default is not a flag, it is an unexploited hole.

    What is left is the rule ``PS-SURF-022`` already stated and the code did not
    keep: a sender the receiving mail service did not vouch for does not become
    a member. They are a stranger, and the unresolved-sender path tells them how
    to get access -- which is what should happen to someone we cannot identify.

    ``None`` on an email surface is UNKNOWN, not "nothing to check". Only
    ``merge_received_email`` ever sets the verdict, so it is absent whenever
    enrichment did not run: no ``email_id`` on the webhook, an ``HTTPError`` on
    the body fetch, or the whole polling receiver. Reading that as the chat
    platforms' "no question to ask" meant an attacker who could make the fetch
    fail -- or a deployment in polling mode -- skipped this check entirely.

        *Liveness.* Each fresh lookup in `resolve` excludes deactivated and

        as. A cached id skipped all of that, so deactivating somebody did not
        take their chat access away -- their next message resolved from here and
        ran as them. One indexed read by primary key re-asks identity the only
        question that can have changed.

        *Proof.* `require_proven_identity` means the caller is about to bind this
        platform account to that Lemma user permanently, so the match behind it
        has to be one the platform attested rather than one the sender asserted.
        The row records the id and not what produced it, so this re-derives --
        see `_cache_is_attested`.

        Refusing every cache hit on the proven path instead was tried and was
        wrong. `_match_proven_sender` matches WhatsApp and nothing else, so the
        cache is the only thing that recognises a Slack or Teams sender at all:
        without it every already-known person on those platforms was sent back

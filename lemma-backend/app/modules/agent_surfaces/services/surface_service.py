        nobody is using. For the address there is a second reason -- the pod's
        org-unique *name* is freed in this same request, so a pod recreated
        under it races the worker for the address.

        The cost, stated rather than discovered: an undeleted pod does not get
        its number back, exactly as it does not get its address back. Somebody
        restoring a pod re-allocates, and may find the pool empty.

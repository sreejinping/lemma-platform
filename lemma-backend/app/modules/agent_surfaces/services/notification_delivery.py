"""Choosing where to reach a person, and what that choice is allowed to assume.

Split out of :mod:`notification_service` because it is the part with real rules
in it and no side effects — which makes it the part worth testing directly.

The choice belongs to the **sending agent**, not the recipient. That is the
identity argument: a pod connects its own Telegram bot or Slack app, and a
message from "the agent you already talk to there" carries the trust that
bot has earned. Reaching someone through an unrelated pod surface because they
once set it as a personal default borrows trust the sender never had, and asks
the recipient to place a message from a bot they have no relationship with.

So the candidate set is the surfaces this agent serves, and the ordering is:

1. **The surface the run is on.** If the agent is answering on Telegram right
   now, that is where it reaches out from — same bot, same conversation, no
   explaining required.
2. **Its other chat surfaces**, freshest inbound first. "Freshest" means where
   they last spoke to *us* — not where we last spoke at them, which is why it
   reads ``last_inbound_at`` and not ``updated_at``.
3. **Its mailbox.** Email is the only family that can address someone who has
   never written to us first, so it is the fallback and the default for agents
   with no chat surface at all.
4. **Nothing** — a legitimate outcome, not an exception. The in-app inbox still
   has the notification. What must never happen is a silent nothing, so the
   reason travels with the result and reaches the API.

An agent that has a reason to prefer one channel says so, and then the ranking
above is not consulted at all: the request is honoured or it fails, never
quietly rerouted. See :func:`surfaces_on_channel` and
``NotificationChannelResolver._resolve_on_channel``.

The recipient's own ``UserPreferences.default_surfaces`` deliberately plays no
part here. It remains authoritative for *inbound* routing
(``SurfaceRouter.select_surface``), where the question is genuinely "which of
our surfaces did this person mean to talk to".

First success wins. Fan-out across three apps is how a genuinely useful feature
comes to read as spam.

"""A ceiling on how often one pod may message one person.

The expected failure this guards is not malice, it is a badly-prompted agent in
a retry loop putting forty messages on a colleague's phone in a minute. Schedules
already have a circuit breaker for their version of this; the send path had
nothing, and PR #264 modelled the limit but never enforced it.

Redis rather than an in-process counter, deliberately: the API, the worker and
the scheduler are separate processes, and a per-process counter would let each
of them spend the whole budget.

A fixed window, not a sliding one. The imprecision at a window boundary (up to
2x the limit across two adjacent windows) is irrelevant for a bound whose job is
to stop a runaway loop, and a fixed window is one INCR instead of a sorted-set
read-modify-write on every send.

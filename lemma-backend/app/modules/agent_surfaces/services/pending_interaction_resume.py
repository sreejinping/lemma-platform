"""Resuming a paused ``ask_user`` / ``request_approval`` from a typed reply.

Lifted out of ``ingress_service`` unchanged: it never touched instance state,
and the ingress service is far past the size where a self-contained 70-line
branch should still be living inside it.

What a reply *means* -- which words approve, how "2" picks an option -- is the
agent's to decide (`agent.contracts.interaction_replies`). This module keeps the
transport half: does the message target the pause at all, did the person ask to
type it, and falling through to an ordinary message when it is not a decision.

Falling through to the normal new-message path is the right answer when the
reply is not an answer — but it is the *wrong* answer when the reply was a
decision we then failed to record. Starting a turn supersedes the pause with an
auto-DENY, so a database hiccup while writing an "approve" silently cancelled
the action the person had just approved: the same question-became-a-cancellation
this module exists to prevent, reached by a different route and logged at debug,
which `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` drops. Hence three outcomes rather than a bool.

    The composer stays enabled while a conversation is WAITING, so somebody can
    type straight past a card — and until this asked, every such message was
    taken as the answer to whatever was pending, however old. A question nobody
    tapped therefore swallowed the next instruction anybody sent, recorded it as
    the answer, and started no run for it. Only surfaces behaved that way; a new
    message from the web or the CLI supersedes a stale pause and carries on (see
    `ConversationTurns.start` -> `supersede_stale_pending_interactions`).

    Three cases are genuinely an answer:

    * the words plainly answer it — an offered option, its number, "approve";
    * they asked to type it, by tapping "Other" on the card, and this is the
      pause they tapped it on;
    * the card reached them as text, so typing is the only way to answer at all.

    That last one is recorded where the text is sent rather than inferred from
    the platform, because the two differ: Slack renders buttons and still falls
    back to a formatted message when a block payload is rejected, and somebody
    looking at plain text has nothing to tap whatever the platform can do.

    Anything else is a new message, and saying so is what lets the normal path
    mark the pause unanswered, tell the agent, and run what was actually asked.

    new message and falls through, so the normal path can mark the pause
    unanswered and run what was actually asked.

    Given that it *is* an answer: ask_user takes a numbered option, an exact
    label, or free text. request_approval takes only a reply expressing a
    decision — "approve"/"yes"/… → APPROVE_ONCE, "approve session"/… →
    APPROVE_FOR_SESSION, "deny"/"no"/… → DENY. Anything else is

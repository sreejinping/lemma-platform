"""What Lemma says on a chat surface, and how each thing is shaped to be said.

Eight verbs, one per thing an agent run can put in front of a person: an answer,
a file or table, a set of questions, an approval card, a sign-in link, a voice
note, and -- for a recipient who has never written to us -- a cold email. Each
builds one :class:`SurfaceEnvelope` and hands it to :class:`SurfaceDelivery`,
which is the only thing here that talks to a platform.

This was ``SurfaceEgressMixin``, one of eight bases on a service that also
handled inbound events, routing, configuration and interactions; the type
checker could not see where ``self.uow`` or ``self.adapter_registry`` came from,
and those unresolvable names were 85% of the repository's baselined type errors.
It is an object with a constructor now. The live-progress verbs went to
:class:`SurfaceProgress` and ``send_to_member`` to :class:`MemberReach`, each
for a reason written down there.

Nothing here reads an inbound event.

"""How a message physically leaves Lemma for a chat surface.

One object with one job, and it is the mechanism rather than the vocabulary:
given a conversation, find the surface, adapter, thread and credentials a reply
goes to, and hand one :class:`SurfaceEnvelope` to that adapter. Everything that
*decides what to say* -- an answer, a question, an approval card, a file -- is
:class:`SurfaceEgress`, which holds one of these.

Why it is its own object: these three methods are the only part of egress that
:class:`SurfaceProgress` also needs, and progress speaks a different adapter API
(edit a live message) from the one here (deliver an envelope). Sharing them by
inheritance is what produced an eight-base ingress service where the type
checker could not see which collaborator any method was reaching for.

Nothing here reads an inbound event.

"""Reverse proxy for signed access to a port inside a sandbox.

Authorisation is the token in the path and nothing else, which is why this
router carries no user dependency: the URL is handed to a browser that has no
Lemma session, and the signature already names the exact sandbox, port, and
expiry it authorises.

Because the token is the whole credential, inbound headers that could be
mistaken for a *different* credential are dropped rather than forwarded -- a
sandbox must never see the caller's Lemma cookies or API key.

Both halves of HTTP are here. The request half streams both bodies through one
shared client rather than buffering them. The **WebSocket** half does not exist for
convenience: a live view of the agent's browser is a frame stream, and a proxy
that can only answer a request cannot carry one. It is a separate route because
an upgrade is a separate protocol, not a method.

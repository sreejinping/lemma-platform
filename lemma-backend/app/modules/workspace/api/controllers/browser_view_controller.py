"""Watching, and driving, the browser inside your own sandbox.

Two routes: one that says what a pane should render without starting anything,
and one socket that carries frames out and input in.

The socket is served from the API's own origin rather than from a per-sandbox
hostname, which is what makes it work in the desktop app: a WKWebView holds the
session cookie for one host, and a view on a different `*.localhost` subdomain
gets no session at all. It also means the token can travel in the query string
the way every other browser WebSocket in this codebase does, because browsers
cannot set headers on a handshake.

Only the owner ever reaches it. A workspace sandbox is keyed by user id, so
there is no identifier in this request that could name somebody else's -- the
session decides whose browser this is.

"""Host sandboxes: a workspace whose commands run on the user's Mac.

See docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md. A host sandbox is an ordinary
sandbox row -- same lifecycle, same state machine -- whose compute is a folder
on the computer of the user a run is for, reached through the Agent Host
paired to them.

**The choice is in the id.** A host sandbox's id is a UUIDv8 carrying a fixed
tag, derived from the conversation it serves. Nothing else this platform mints
is a v8 (workspaces are user ids, function sandboxes pod ids, both v4 or v7),
so which fabric a sandbox runs on is readable from the id alone, cannot change
for the life of the sandbox, and needs no lookup on the hot path. That is the
contract's "recorded on the sandbox": an operation on a host sandbox can only
ever go to the host, and one on any other sandbox never can.

**One per conversation.** The root is per conversation (§5), and the user's
ordinary VM workspace -- where their browser lives -- keeps its own id. A run
that executes on the host therefore uses two sandboxes: this one for commands
and files, and the VM one for the browser.

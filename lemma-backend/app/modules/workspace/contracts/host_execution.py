"""Host execution, as the agent module drives it.

See docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md. The agent module decides that
a run executes on the user's Mac (§2); this is how it then opens the run's
host sandbox and learns its root. Tool sessions on it come from
``get_workspace_tool_runtime().get_host_session``.

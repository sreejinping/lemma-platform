"""Every provider answers the same contract, checked against every provider.

The three providers are constructed very differently -- one wraps a Docker
engine, one an E2B SDK class, one a guest bridge subprocess -- so this is one
module that builds all three rather than a suite each inherits.

What it is for: `browser_cdp_endpoint` was added to the ops protocol,
implemented on Docker only, and shipped. E2B and the desktop guest raised
`AttributeError` from inside a request handler. Every assertion below would have
failed on that commit.

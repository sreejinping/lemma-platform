"""The E2B output buffer's cursor, at and past the retention cap.

`E2BOutputBuffer` had no unit coverage at all -- it was exercised only by an
integration test that needs a real E2B sandbox, so the defect these tests pin
survived in a file whose own docstring describes the correct behaviour.

Run against `fakeredis` rather than a hand-written stand-in on purpose. The
arithmetic here depends on exactly what `LTRIM`, `LRANGE` and `LINDEX` do at
their boundaries, and a stand-in asserts only what its author already believed
those commands do -- the same belief that produced the defect.

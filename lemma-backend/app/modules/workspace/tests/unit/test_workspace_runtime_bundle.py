"""Installing the overlay must be free when nothing changed, and safe when it fails.

Two properties carry this feature. The first is cost: it runs on the way to every
tool call, on a path whose remaining expense is already one provider round trip,
so "already installed" has to be answerable without touching the sandbox at all.
The second is blast radius: a sandbox that cannot take the overlay still has the
copy baked into its image, so a failure here must cost staleness rather than the
caller's tool call.

Both are asserted against a client that counts what it was asked to do, because
both are claims about I/O that no amount of reading the code can settle.

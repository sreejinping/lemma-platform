"""What a broken workspace tells the caller.

Every test here is about the *shape* of a failure rather than the failure
itself. The desktop bug these were written for was not that a sandbox broke --
it was that a broken sandbox was indistinguishable from a slow one, so a file
listing span five minutes and then returned `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` with a null
message. Three separate defects had to line up for that, and each has a test.

The bridge is a real subprocess and the runtime is a real HTTP server, for the
reason the neighbouring module gives: framing, exit codes and status codes are
the thing under test, so mocking them away would certify nothing.

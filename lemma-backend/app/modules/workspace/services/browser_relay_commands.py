"""What the backend asks a sandbox's shell to do before a viewer arrives.

Its own module because it is a different kind of thing from the rest of the
relay client: that file is about talking to a process over HTTP, and this is a
shell script the backend ships in a `start_process` call. Most of what is here
is rollout scaffolding -- `command -v` fallbacks and an exported variable that
exist only to reach sandboxes running an image older than this code -- and each
piece carries the date it can be deleted in its own comment. Kept together so
that when the image has rolled everywhere, the deletion is one file.

#: Bring the display stack up, on this image or on the one before it.
#:
#: `lemma-ensure-display` is `start-browser` renamed. The rename ships in the
#: image and the image rollout is deliberately deferred, so for as long as
#: that gap is open a backend that only knew the new name would fail to start
#: the browser at all on every sandbox still running the old one -- not
#: degrade, fail: the command does not exist, the relay never comes up, and
#: the viewer gets "the browser relay did not start".
#:
#: Falling back costs one `command -v`. It comes out when the images are
#: rolled, and until then this is the difference between a deploy that is
#: safe in either order and one that is not.
#:
#: `start-vnc-bridge` is the viewing half -- x11vnc and websockify, 66 MiB
#: measured -- which `lemma-ensure-display` no longer starts, because an
#: agent doing research pays for it and nobody is watching. This is the
#: viewer's own path, so this is where it is asked for. Guarded by
#: `command -v` for the same rollout reason as the line above: on an image
#: that predates the split, the two are already running and there is
#: nothing to start.
#: The proxy decision, applied here as well as in the script, and this is
#: the half that reaches the fleet that exists today.
#:
#: The script reads the decision file itself -- but the script lives in the
#: *image*, and the profile digest is deliberately not bumped in this branch,
#: because bumping it refuses reuse of every existing sandbox and on E2B that
#: means a new disk and a person's files gone. So on every sandbox already
#: running, `lemma-ensure-display` is still the old one, which knows only
#: `AGENT_BROWSER_PROXY`. Without these lines the server could not withdraw a
#: proxy from a single sandbox currently proxied -- which is the entire
#: feature, aimed exactly at the fleet that cannot get the new script.
#:
#: Harmless on a new image, and deliberately so: that script begins by
#: `unset`ting `AGENT_BROWSER_PROXY` and reading the file itself, so the
#: export below is overwritten by the same answer it came from. The two
#: cannot disagree, because both read one file.
#:
#: Deletable when the image has rolled everywhere, like the `command -v`
#: fallbacks around it.

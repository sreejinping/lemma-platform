"""A drop-in replacement for ``LocalSandboxClient``, backed by this module.

Deliberately shaped as a client rather than a new session type. The session
above it -- its output cursor, its backpressure handling, its process
collection loop, its deterministic python-session ids -- is subtle code that
works, and rewriting it to reach a different provider would have risked all of
it to change one dependency. Matching the client surface instead means the
session is untouched and only the object behind ``self.client`` differs.

``logical_id`` is the sandbox id. That equality is not a coincidence: the
migration set each backfilled default workspace's id to the user id precisely
so every existing caller keeps addressing the same sandbox.

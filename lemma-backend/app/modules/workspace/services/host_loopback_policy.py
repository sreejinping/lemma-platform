"""Which sandbox gets the loopback relay to this Mac.

On Desktop a user's agent can run commands on the Mac (host execution,
docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md), so the dev server it starts
listens on the Mac's own `127.0.0.1`. The browser that checks the result runs
in that user's workspace sandbox in the guest VM. The loopback relay
(docs/architecture/desktop-security.md, "The loopback relay") is how that
browser reaches the Mac's loopback, and this decides who has it.

There is no installation owner. The relay leads to *this* Mac, so it belongs
to whoever *this Mac's own Agent Host* is paired to -- the host running next
to this backend, not any host that happens to be paired to it. Exactly one
kind of sandbox gets it: a **workspace**, owned by a **person**, on a
**Desktop** install, whose user holds a live pairing with this Mac's Agent
Host.

"This Mac's Agent Host" is read from its own config, which locald points the
backend at (`DESKTOP_AGENT_HOST_CONFIG_PATH`): the host ids of its pairings.
A host id is minted by this backend when a host pairs and handed only to that
host, so another machine -- a teammate's own Mac paired to this Lemma, or an
Agent Host somebody ran inside their own sandbox -- holds a different one and
cannot present this Mac's. A function sandbox has no browser. Anyone else's
workspace shares this computer but not its loopback.

Whether that host is online or has "Run commands on this Mac" switched on is
not part of the grant: both change while a sandbox lives, and the grant is
fixed when the container is made. locald's end of the relay checks the switch
on every connection instead, so the relay carries nothing while it is off and
works as soon as it is turned on, with no container to replace.

Asked each time a sandbox is provisioned, and the answer is fixed into the
container; guestd replaces a running container whose grants differ from the
ones a provision asks for, rather than reusing it with the old reach.

"""Adopting or minting the disk a sandbox runs on.

A mixin rather than a collaborator because it needs the service's provider and
unit-of-work factory and has no state of its own -- the same reason
``ConversationRunQueriesMixin`` is one. Split out to keep ``sandbox_service``
under the architecture ratchet's file-size limit.

The rule it exists to enforce: a volume is adopted before one is created. The
disk holding a user's files was named from a token this schema never knew, so it
is found by label. Only when there is genuinely nothing to adopt is a name
minted -- and that is also the moment the storage generation moves, because it
is the moment the user's files are actually gone.

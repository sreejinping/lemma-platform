    This is the boundary that decides whether two deployments can see each
    other's sandboxes, and it used to have a shared default. Both `lemma-dev`
    and `lemma-prod` held their own `E2B_API_KEY`, but the two keys resolved to
    one E2B team, and neither set a namespace -- so each backend enumerated the
    other's sandboxes, found no row for them in its own database, and destroyed
    them as orphans. One user's workspace was wiped five times inside a single
    twenty-minute conversation, each kill landing seconds after the other
    environment rebuilt it.

    So there is no shared default any more. An explicit `E2B_METADATA_NAMESPACE`
    always wins; otherwise the namespace is derived from `ENVIRONMENT`, which
    already distinguishes the deployments that collided.

    `local` and `testing` are refused rather than derived. Deriving would give
    every developer's machine and every CI run the same namespace, which
    rebuilds the same collision at a smaller scale -- and those are precisely
    the deployments that pair a throwaway database with a real E2B account, the
    combination that turns a sweep into a deletion. A warning would not do:
    warnings in local development are not read, and the cost of missing one is
    somebody else's work.

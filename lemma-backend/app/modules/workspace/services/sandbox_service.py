"""Sandbox lifecycle: turning a durable row into running, addressable compute.

The whole state machine is small enough to read in one sitting, which is the
point. Deterministic naming means a create is idempotent, so there is no
attempt ledger to reconcile and no ambiguity to repair -- the recovery for
"did that create land?" is to look at the name.

Two rules carry most of the correctness:

*Recreating always bumps the epoch.* Even when the old container is already
gone and its name is free, reusing it would let a handle held across the
recreate resolve to the replacement, which is exactly the silent-wrong-target
write the fence exists to prevent.

*A volume is adopted before one is created.* The disk holding a user's files
was named from a token this schema never knew, so it is found by label. Only
when there is genuinely nothing to adopt is a name minted -- and that is also
the moment the storage generation moves, because it is the moment the user's
files are actually gone.

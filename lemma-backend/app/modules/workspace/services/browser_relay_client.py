"""Talking to the browser relay inside a sandbox.

The one place that knows the relay exists. Everything above it -- the view
controller, the sign-in flow -- asks this for a browser, a session, or a socket,
and never learns which fabric the sandbox is on.

The token is derived, not stored: HMAC of a configured key over the sandbox's
provider id, the same arrangement the workspace runtime uses. That means
delivering it again after a resume produces the same value, so re-delivery is
idempotent and there is no per-sandbox secret to keep in a table and rotate.

        No target in the query: VNC shows the shared Xvfb display rather than
        one CDP-selected tab, so there is nothing to name. `session` is not a
        selector either -- it cannot be, for the same reason -- it is only
        which name the driving lease is recorded under, so the agent's own
        script (which checks a lease for *its* session before acting) is not
        told a login session's wheel is free while a person is visibly
        driving it on this same shared screen. Callers pass the session
        `ensure_browser` actually resolved, not one they derive themselves.

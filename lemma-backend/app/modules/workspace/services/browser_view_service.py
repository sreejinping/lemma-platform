"""Turning "this person wants to see their browser" into a live connection.

The whole of the fabric-specific work lives below this: ensure the sandbox is
up, hand its relay the token, find the browser (starting it and steering it to
an origin if asked), and produce the socket URL to attach to.

Ownership is not checked here, because there is nothing to check. A workspace
sandbox is keyed by user id, so resolving *this person's* sandbox is what makes
the view theirs -- there is no identifier a caller could pass to reach somebody
else's. That is worth stating, because the previous design took a sandbox id
from the request and had to defend it.

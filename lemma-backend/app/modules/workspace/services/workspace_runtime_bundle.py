"""Keeping a sandbox's first-party Python current, without replacing the sandbox.

A mixin rather than a collaborator, for the reason ``SandboxVolumeMixin`` is one:
it needs the service's manager client and has no state of its own beyond a cache,
and ``workspace_sandbox_service`` is at the size the architecture ratchet allows.

The shape of the work is the same as ``_ensure_workspace_directory`` beside it --
something that must be true inside the sandbox before a session uses it, made
cheap by remembering that it already is. The difference is what "already" means:
a directory is a property of the disk, while the overlay is a property of the
*sandbox*, so the key is the allocation and the generation, and a sandbox that
was replaced re-probes rather than trusting a remembered answer.

**Failure degrades, it does not propagate.** A sandbox that cannot take the
overlay still has the image's own copy of the first-party code, which is what
every sandbox runs today. Failing a tool call because a 1.6 MB upload timed out
would be a worse outcome than the staleness it was trying to fix -- and staleness
is the status quo, not a regression this introduced.

    Module-level so the real-sandbox test runs the command this actually emits
    rather than a copy of it that can drift.

    It runs unelevated, on both fabrics. That is not luck: the images create
    `/opt/lemma-runtime` owned by the sandbox user and bake the `.pth` with
    exactly the bytes the installer would write, so the one path that needs root
    -- writing into the interpreter's own site-packages -- is never taken. Both
    were verified against live sandboxes, the second byte for byte, because a
    `.pth` differing by so much as a trailing newline would send the installer
    into a root-owned directory.

    The `sudo -n` probe stays as insurance rather than as the plan. A sandbox
    created from an image that predates the baking still has a root-owned
    `/opt/lemma-runtime`, and during a rollout those exist; where sudo is absent
    too, the install fails cleanly and the baked copy keeps serving.

    `/opt` rather than somewhere under the home, deliberately. It is where
    add-on software belongs, it keeps what the platform installed out of the
    directory listing the user browses, and it keeps the disk-copy set that a
    later migration works from as "the user's files".

    It persists on every fabric. On E2B the sandbox is the disk. On Docker and
    `lemma_local` it is its own mount beside the home -- a volume named after
    the workspace volume, and a directory beside the home on Desktop's guest --
    so a replaced container starts with the overlay already installed, and the
    stamp this probes says so. Without the mount the container layer took it,
    and the next ensure paid a reinstall. It goes when the sandbox's storage
    does. A replacement on a newer image keeps the overlay until the version
    moves; the overlay carries only Lemma's code, and the image's third-party
    closure moves only with a lockfile that the bundle is built against too.

    The workspace server is the one process that imports its code at container
    start, so an install does not reach it. `workspace_runtime_restart` restarts
    the sandbox once, when that is safe, for a server not running this overlay.

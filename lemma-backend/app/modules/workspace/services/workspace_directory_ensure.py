"""Making a conversation's working directory exist, and saying so when it cannot.

Its own module because the file it came from is at the size limit, and this is
the part with a shape of its own: a cache, one in-flight task shared by every
caller asking for the same directory, and a retry loop bounded by two different
deadlines -- the sandbox manager's, and the one a person waiting on a file
listing can afford.

A mixin rather than a helper class for the same reason `WorkspaceRuntimeBundleMixin`

say less than it costs.

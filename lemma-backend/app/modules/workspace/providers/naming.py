"""Deterministic resource names, which is what makes create idempotent.

The name is derived entirely from durable state, so retrying a create either
creates the object or finds it already present. That single property is what
removes the need for a create-attempt ledger and a reconciler to repair
creates whose outcome was never learned.

The epoch in a container name is also the fence. An operation issued against
epoch 4 names a container that no longer exists once the sandbox has moved to
epoch 5, so it fails definitively instead of landing on the replacement. This
is why the epoch must be in the *name* rather than only in a label: a label
would have to be read to be checked, and by then the operation has already
been routed.

Volumes are the exception and deliberately so. A volume name may not be
derived, because the volume that exists today was named `ab-ws-{token}` from a
random token in a database that is being retired. Deriving would silently
strand a user's files, so volumes are looked up by label and adopted, and only
named by this module when there is genuinely nothing to adopt.

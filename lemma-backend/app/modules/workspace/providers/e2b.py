"""E2B sandbox provider.

Written against the E2B SDK as it is now, not as the previous adapter found it.
Three capabilities that adapter predated do most of the work here, and each one
removes machinery rather than adding it:

*Metadata queries* give E2B an identity mechanism. A sandbox is created with
`{lemma-sandbox-id, lemma-epoch}` in its metadata and found again by querying
for it. That is the same idea as the deterministic container name on Docker --
identity derived from durable state -- so create is idempotent here too, and
for the same reason: look before creating, and a retry after a lost response
finds the sandbox instead of making a second one.

*Pause and resume* is a real suspend primitive. Releasing a sandbox pauses it
and keeps its disk; the next ensure reconnects to the same sandbox. The
previous adapter had to destroy and recreate, which is why it needed a separate
notion of native storage that outlived the sandbox.

*The sandbox is the disk.* Verified against the real service: write a file,
pause, reconnect, and it is still there. That is how production stores every
workspace -- the account holds no volumes. E2B does have volumes now, and they
are in the pinned SDK, but they were considered and rejected: they are network
storage, which is what pod files already are, so mounting one here would add a
second remote filesystem to hold what this one already holds. So `storage_kind`
is SANDBOX_NATIVE, and adoption is not an optimisation but the only safe
behaviour: creating a second sandbox for an existing identity would leave the
user's files in the first with nothing pointing at it. Adoption therefore
ignores the epoch, and the fence becomes the E2B sandbox id, which only changes
when the sandbox genuinely is new.

Because the sandbox is the disk, *nothing here replaces a workspace*. Drift is
recorded and adopted; see `create`.

What is deliberately *not* carried over: layered retry loops around every call.
A provider's job is to report what happened; deciding whether to wait and try
again belongs to the service, which is the only layer that knows the caller's
deadline. Errors here are classified and raised, not absorbed.

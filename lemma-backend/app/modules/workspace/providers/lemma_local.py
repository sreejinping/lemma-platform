"""Lemma Desktop's local sandbox provider.

Desktop ships its own VZ (macOS) or WSL (Windows) guest and manages sandboxes
through a native bridge rather than a Docker socket. The bridge speaks one
JSON request per invocation over stdio, and is capability-authenticated by
being the executable Desktop installed -- there is no port to reach it on and
no credential to leak.

Two things make it fit the same seam as Docker and E2B without special cases:

*Its ensure is already idempotent.* `sandbox.ensure` either creates the guest
sandbox or returns the one that is there, which is the property the whole
provisioning design rests on.

*Its sandbox is its own storage.* The guest ties a workspace's disk to the
sandbox id, so like E2B this is SANDBOX_NATIVE: a new epoch adopts the same
sandbox rather than replacing it, because replacing it would take the user's
files with it.

Once a sandbox is running, processes, PTY, Python and filesystem all go through
the identical workspace-runtime protocol Docker uses -- the guest exposes the
same runtime on the same contract, so none of that code is duplicated here.

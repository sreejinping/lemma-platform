"""The provider seam: what it takes to rent a sandbox from some compute fabric.

Kept deliberately narrow. A provider creates, starts, stops, destroys, and
enumerates compute; everything about *which* sandbox, *when*, and *why* is the
service's business.

This is the seam a remote Docker endpoint or a Kubernetes cluster plugs into,
which is why it speaks in names and labels rather than in allocations: a
Deployment, a container, and an E2B sandbox all have a name you choose and
labels you can query, and that is enough to own them.

The shape it replaces carried allocation ids, allocation tokens, admission
classes, and a create-attempt ledger, because a create whose response was lost
could not be distinguished from one that never happened. Deterministic naming
removes that question -- retrying a create either creates the name or finds it
already there -- so the ledger, the reconciler, and the ambiguity vocabulary
around create all go away. What remains is `ProviderCreateAmbiguous`, for the
genuinely unresolvable case where the provider cannot even be asked.

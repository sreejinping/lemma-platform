"""Turning E2B's streaming output into a resumable, sequenced cursor.

This is the one genuine impedance mismatch in the E2B provider, and it is worth
naming precisely. E2B delivers process output by *pushing* it to a callback
while a connection is held open. Every caller above this module *pulls* it:
"give me everything after sequence N, and wait up to M seconds for more". That
pull model is not an accident -- it is what lets a workspace session be rebuilt
on every tool call, survive a backend restart mid-command, and let two pollers
read the same long-running process without stealing bytes from each other.

So the provider owns the buffer that E2B does not have. Callbacks append into a
sequenced Redis list; reads serve from it. On the Docker path this same buffer
lives inside the sandbox, maintained by the workspace runtime. On E2B there is
nowhere in the sandbox to put it, so it lives here instead.

Redis rather than process memory, deliberately: an in-process dict would tie a
running command to the one backend process that happened to start it, so a
rolling restart -- or simply a second replica handling the next poll -- would
lose output the agent had not read yet.

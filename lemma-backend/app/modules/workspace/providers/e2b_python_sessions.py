"""Python sessions on E2B, which are a file rather than an interpreter.

Its own module because `e2b_ops` was at the size limit and this half has a
different shape from the rest of it: the runtime-backed fabrics keep a resident
interpreter per session, and here a session is a pickle on disk that each
execution loads and rewrites. What survives between calls is therefore whatever
pickles, which is the one thing about this surface a caller has to know.

Free functions taking the ops object rather than a mixin: they need its sandbox
connection and output buffer, and a fourth base class on the provider buys
nothing that an argument does not.

    The workspace image keeps a real interpreter per session. E2B's plain
    sandbox does not, so both properties are rebuilt here from what it does
    offer, and neither is faked:

    *Continuity* -- each execution restores the session's namespace from
    disk and saves it back, so a name bound in one call is available in the
    next. Only picklable values survive, which is the honest limit: an open
    file handle cannot cross a process boundary, and pretending it did
    would be worse than losing it.

    *A result* -- a REPL reports the value of a trailing expression, so the
    code is split with `ast` and the last node evaluated separately when it
    is an expression. Without this, `x = 6 * 7` followed by `x` returns
    nothing and an agent cannot see what it computed.

    *A working directory* -- the interpreter starts in the session's `cwd`,
    the very same one `start_process` gives a shell command. A fresh process
    per call means there is no shell to inherit it from, and without this it
    started in whatever directory the image defaults to: `execute_python`
    reported `/workspace` while `exec_command` reported the conversation's
    own directory, so a file one tool wrote by relative path was invisible
    to the other.

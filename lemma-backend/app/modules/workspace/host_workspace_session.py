"""A workspace session whose paths are the owner's own, on their Mac.

The VM session canonicalises every path under ``/home/user`` because that is
the only tree a VM sandbox has. A host sandbox's root is a real folder on the
Mac (docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md §5), so this session keeps the
host's absolute paths as they are and resolves relative ones against the root.
It never rewrites a command string, and it does not police containment: the
exec-server checks every file path against the root, ``$TMPDIR`` and the
owner's grants, and Seatbelt enforces the same underneath it.

Everything else -- output cursors, backpressure, process collection -- is the
VM session's, unchanged, because the provider below speaks the same protocol.

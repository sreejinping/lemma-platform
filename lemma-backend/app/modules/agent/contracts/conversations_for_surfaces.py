"""What a chat surface does to a conversation, as operations rather than a service.

The last thing `app/composition/surface_agent.py` existed to hand over was a
`ConversationService`, and handing one over is what let a delivery surface reach
a repository in another module. Twenty call sites in `agent_surfaces` went
through it, and most of them were not method calls at all -- they read a
collaborator *off* the service (`conversation_repository`, `agent_repository`,
`usage_service`, `uow`, `authorization_service`, `fallback_model_name`) and
`services/interaction_helpers.py` assembled a second service out of six of them.

Twelve operations replace it. Two of the six collaborators turned out to be
dead weight: `ConversationService` stores `authorization_service` and
`fallback_model_name` and neither it nor any of the five coordinators it builds
ever reads them -- `agent/api/dependencies.py` has never even passed a
`fallback_model_name`, so every surface was threading `None` across a module
boundary. They are still on the constructor -- taking a parameter off it is a
change to every place in `agent` that builds one, and not this change -- but
nothing crosses a module boundary for them any more.

Every operation takes the unit of work rather than being handed a bound service,
which is also what makes the worker's two modes disappear from the caller: the
ingress service used to carry both a `conversation_service` and a
`conversation_service_factory` so the long-I/O path could rebuild one against a
short session. A function taking a `uow` is the same function in both.

`agent/contracts/agents.py` covers two of the `agent_repository` reaches
outright -- `agent_name_for_id` for a raw name and `agent_id_for_name` for a
name a person typed -- and `agent/contracts/pod_summaries.py` covers the pod
listing, so the only agent lookup published here is the one that needs an
agent's *kind* to decide what a person should be shown it is called.

A submodule rather than `contracts/__init__`, which is a leaf: these reach the
service and repository layers, and everything importing any agent contract would
otherwise pay for it.

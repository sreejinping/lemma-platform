"""Running one thing on the system model, from outside `agent`.

An operation, not the four names behind it. Two callers needed the system model
-- `schedule`'s event filter and `pod_bundle`'s README polish -- and each
assembled it itself: resolve the default system profile, take its public
snapshot, take its credentials, take its harness model name, hand all three to
the model factory, then remember to run its own usage limits through
`usage_limits_for`. Five lines and four names, duplicated, in two modules that
have no business knowing a model is a thing built out of a runtime profile. That
knowledge is what `app/composition/{schedule_filter,pod_bundle_readme}.py` were:
moving `usage_limits_for` between two agent service modules broke a README
generator. `AgentRuntimeProfileService`, `default_system_runtime` and
`require_pydantic_ai_model_from_runtime_profile` stay unpublished; this is the
call that replaces them.

The ceiling is the caller's, which is why it is an argument rather than a
constant here: the filter and the polish budget different amounts. What comes
back is not necessarily what went in. A model that cannot pre-count tokens
enforces a cap only *after* the provider has been called and billed, so
`usage_limits_for` drops `count_tokens_before_request` rather than raising --
and `usage_limits` below is what this model will genuinely honour. A caller
whose input has no upper size still has to bound it itself; `_MAX_EVENT_CHARS`
in schedule's filter is that bound, and it exists because of exactly this.

A submodule rather than `contracts/__init__.py`, which is a leaf: this reaches
the runtime profile service, and everything importing any agent contract would
otherwise pay for it. Same reason as `workflow_control.py` next door.

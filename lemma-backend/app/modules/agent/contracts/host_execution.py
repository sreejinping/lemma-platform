"""The Agent Host link, as the workspace module needs it for host execution.

See docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md. The workspace's host provider
sends each sandbox operation as an ``op`` over the host's link, to the host
``host_for_host_sandbox`` names, re-opening with ``host_folder_for`` when the
host has forgotten the workspace; selection asks which of a user's hosts can
take them, and the loopback relay asks whether a user is paired to this Mac's
own host. All are published here rather than
reached into, so the link's internals stay the agent module's to change.

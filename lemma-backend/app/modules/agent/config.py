"""Agent module configuration.

Field names are unchanged from the former monolithic ``Settings`` so the
environment variables resolve identically (``WIDGET_URL_SECRET``,
``DEEPGRAM_API_KEY``, …).

NOTE: the server-provided system LLM *model profile* (``LEMMA_*``), web search
(``WEB_SEARCH_*``) and embeddings (``EMBEDDING_*``) stay in core config — they
are cross-cutting platform capabilities consumed by ``app/core/*``, scripts and
the test harness, not purely agent-internal.

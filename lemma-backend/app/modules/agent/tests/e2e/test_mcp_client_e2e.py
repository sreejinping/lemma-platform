"""E2E: the Lemma MCP surfaces, over the transports their callers really use.

The pod MCP endpoint is driven with an actual MCP client (the full
``initialize`` -> ``notifications/initialized`` -> ``tools/list`` ->
``tools/call`` handshake) over the wire against a real backend server.

A conversation's tools are reached only by a local agent, through the Agent
Host: its MCP bridge relays each call as an ``mcp`` frame on the host's link
WebSocket, and waits on a parked interaction with ``interaction_wait``. Those
tests drive the link. The conversation's HTTP MCP mount they used to drive is
gone, because the Agent Host was its only caller; what they prove about
authorization -- the run's token, the agent's own grants, pod membership --
moved with the tools onto the link and is asserted there.

They guard the regression where the FastMCP apps were built with
``stateless_http=False``: the server then held the ``Mcp-Session-Id`` session in
the memory of whichever worker handled ``initialize``, and the follow-up
``initialized`` notification landing on a different worker/replica got a
``404 Not Found`` ("session expired"). Codex's rmcp client read that as a fatal
transport error and aborted ``thread/start``. ``test_mcp_endpoint_is_stateless``
asserts the property that fixes it (no server-held session), and the behavioral
tests confirm a real client completes the handshake and calls tools.

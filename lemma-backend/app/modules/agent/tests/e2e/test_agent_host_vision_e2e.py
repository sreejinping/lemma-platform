"""Whether an Agent Host run may look at a PDF page, decided end to end.

Desktop's common configuration has no ``VISION_MODEL``: the model *is* the
harness -- Claude Code or Codex on the user's own machine -- and those read
images natively, so there is nothing to delegate to and nothing to configure.
Everything therefore rests on the MCP bridge deriving ``DIRECT`` from the run's
runtime. Get it wrong and ``pod_view_document_pages`` answers "no vision model
is configured" for a host that can see perfectly well.

The existing unit coverage mocks ``AgentRuntimeProfileService.resolve`` and
asserts the bridge uses its return value. That is worth having, and it cannot
fail for the reason this actually breaks: a mock always resolves. What decides
it in production is whether resolution *succeeds* against a real harness
profile -- one whose stored runtime is ``{"profile_id": ...}`` with no model
name, whose ``default_model_name`` may be unset, and whose catalog was frozen
before the host's ACP probe reported what it could do.

So nothing here is doubled below the bridge: a real paired host, a real
published harness, a real profile built from it, a real run, and the shipped
``_load_agent_context``.

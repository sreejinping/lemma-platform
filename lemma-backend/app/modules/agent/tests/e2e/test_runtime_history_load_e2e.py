"""The bounded history loader, against a real PostgreSQL.

The unit tests cover the selection policy -- that loading only what gets sent
picks the same messages as loading everything. They cannot cover the SQL that
produces that shape: the per-run counts, and the two ``DISTINCT ON`` reads that
pull each older run's first and last message. Those are the parts that can be
silently wrong (or silently unbounded) and still pass a test built on fakes.

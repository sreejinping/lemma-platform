"""A host must never be able to wedge itself by reporting the same update.

Delivery is at-least-once and the host only clears a control update from its
outbox once the backend accepts it. So an update the backend refuses is an
update the host resends every poll, forever. And because the poll that carries
control updates up is the same poll that carries commands down, refusing one
checkpoint stops CANCEL_RUN and RESOLVE_PERMISSION reaching that host for
*every* run it is executing.

The trigger is not a buggy host. A laptop sleeps for half an hour; Lemma
reconciles the run to RECOVERING and then to the terminal DISPATCH_UNKNOWN; the
laptop wakes and heartbeats the RUNNING it still believes in.

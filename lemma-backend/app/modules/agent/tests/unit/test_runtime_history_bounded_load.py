"""Loading only the history that gets sent must select what loading it all did.

The runtime prompt keeps every message of the five most recent runs and elides
each older run to its first and last. It used to get there by loading the whole
transcript and discarding most of it -- p90 271 messages at run time, p99 13688,
each carrying its text and its tool argument and result JSON -- so a long
conversation was slow to start for no benefit.

The loader now returns older runs already reduced to two messages, carrying
``total_message_count`` so the elision notice and the surface budget still know
how big the run really was. These tests pin the equivalence: for the same
conversation, the bounded shape and the full shape must select the same
messages, with the same counts.

"""What a dispatched run's prompt has to carry, and when.

A Lemma conversation maps to one provider session, kept in one working
directory, so the prompt is just the latest user message: the agent loads the
rest back itself. Sending more would duplicate the conversation in its context.

The exception is a harness that never advertised ``loadSession``. There is no
session to resume there, ever, and one lone message leaves the agent answering
a follow-up it has never seen the start of. It costs nothing in the usual case:
a resumable harness only lacks a stored session on a conversation's first turn,
where there is no history to send.

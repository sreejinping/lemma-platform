"""The Python half of the wire contract in the Agent Host's shared fixture.

`agent-host/tests/wire_contract.rs` asserts the same file. Two things exist
twice across the two languages and nothing used to check that the copies agree:

* ``EventType`` / ``AgentHostEventType`` — a value one side emits and the other
  does not know is an event that arrives and is dropped;
* ``chunk_text`` / ``event_text`` — the host accumulates streamed text with one
  and this process re-accumulates it with the other, reconciling the two
  buffers at every segment boundary. A disagreement raises nothing. It
  silently truncates a persisted message, which is precisely how the
  seal-and-clear bug in ``Segment`` stayed invisible;
* the ``RunSpec`` field list — a field added on one side and not the other is
  either a spec the host silently ignores or one this process cannot see, and
  the fixture is also where ``mcp``'s deliberate absence from this side is
  written down so nobody closes the gap by declaring it here;
* the wire enums and the link's frames, close codes and error codes -- the
  host branches on every one of them, and a value only one side knows is a
  request nobody answers or a close the host misreads.

Guards the steering that keeps agents reading the pod's pre-generated document
markdown (``files cat --pages`` / ``files child``) instead of downloading and
re-OCR'ing pod files through LiteParse — the regression observed where an agent
ran ``lemma files download`` + ``lit parse`` on documents the pod had already
converted at upload.

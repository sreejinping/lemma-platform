"""Messages sent mid-run reach the run that is already answering.

The reported failure: four WhatsApp bubbles (three photos and the question they
were about) arrived as four webhooks. The first started a run; the other three

person got an answer about the photos and three acknowledgements for a next turn
no code path would start.

"""Base prompt composition for agent harnesses.

Every agent's system prompt is composed the same way: the pod resource map
(identical for every run, so it caches), then a base prompt (the
pod's own teammate, or a named agent), then a per-toolset guidance fragment for
each toolset the agent actually has, then the agent/conversation instructions and
the runtime context brief. Tool guidance lives once, in the fragment files mapped
by ``FRAGMENT_BY_TOOLSET`` — the teammate is rich because it has every toolset,
not because its base prompt restates each tool.

Resource authoring details live in skills; tool schemas describe arguments.

"""ACP permission requests expressed as ordinary Lemma approvals.

An Agent Host run pauses when its ACP agent asks to use a native tool. The host
holds that request open (``desktop/agent-host/src/permissions/``) until a decision
comes back as a ``RESOLVE_PERMISSION`` command, so the pause sits *inside* a
live run rather than at a run boundary — unlike ``ask_user`` /
``request_approval``, which end their run and resume through a new one.

Rendering the request as a ``request_approval`` tool call is what lets one
approval path serve every entry point: the web client reads the persisted call,
Slack/Teams/Telegram render native buttons from it, and all of them resolve
through the same endpoint. Only the *destination* of the decision differs — a
host command instead of a resumed pydantic-ai run — and that is decided by the
marker this module writes into the call's arguments.

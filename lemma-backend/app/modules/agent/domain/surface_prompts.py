"""What the model is told about the third-party platform it is talking on.

A surface is ingress, agent, egress: it hands the agent typed facts about its
platform (`agent_surfaces.contracts.platforms.PlatformFacts`) and the agent
decides what to say about them. Every word the model reads on a surface run is
written here, so the two harnesses cannot drift apart -- the in-process one
receives it through ``SurfacePlatformCapability`` and the remote ones through
``build_system_prompt``, and both call :func:`surface_platform_guidance`.

Pure string assembly, no I/O: safe on the prompt-build hot path, and stable per
conversation (a conversation never changes platform), so it rides in the cached
system-prompt prefix.

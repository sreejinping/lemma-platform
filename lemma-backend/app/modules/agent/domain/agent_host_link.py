"""The frames of the Agent Host link: one WebSocket per paired host.

See docs/architecture/agent-host.md#the-link. The same vocabulary is defined a
second time in ``desktop/agent-host/src/link/protocol.rs``, and both copies are
held to ``desktop/agent-host/tests/fixtures/wire_contract.json`` by
``test_agent_host_wire_contract.py``. A frame one side sends and the other does
not know is a request that is never answered, so nothing here is renamed without
changing the fixture in the same commit.

Every frame is ``{type, id?, re?, body}``. ``id`` names a request that expects
an answer and ``re`` on the answer points back at it; pushes carry neither.

The bodies reuse the domain models the HTTP routes already took, on purpose:
the link moved the transport and kept every rule. What is new is only what a
socket needs and a request/response pair did not -- somewhere to say which
update was refused, and a vocabulary of close codes.

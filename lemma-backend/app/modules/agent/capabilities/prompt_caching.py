"""Prompt-caching capability, per provider protocol.

Two different levers, because the two provider families cache differently.

OpenAI-compatible providers reuse the request prefix automatically; the lever we
control is *session affinity* — routing a conversation's turns to the same
replica so the cached prefix is reused. The assembler keys affinity on the pod
and agent, so a new conversation lands where that agent's long, shared prompt
start is already cached, and a conversation's turns still land together; the
conversation id is the fallback. Never the agent-run id, which changes every
turn and would scatter routing, defeating cross-turn reuse.

Anthropic caches nothing without an explicit breakpoint, so we ask pydantic-ai
to mark one after the static instruction blocks. That only pays off because the
current-time note is a ``UserPromptPart`` rather than a ``SystemPromptPart``:
Anthropic hoists system parts into the top-level ``system`` parameter ahead of
the instruction blocks, so a per-turn timestamp there would change the prefix on
every request and the breakpoint would never hit. See ``current_time.py``.

Provider-specific extensions (e.g. Fireworks ``x-session-affinity`` header) can
be layered in subclasses via ``configure_caching_capability()`` in assembler.py.

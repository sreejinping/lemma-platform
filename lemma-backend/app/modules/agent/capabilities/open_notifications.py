"""Telling an agent that somebody is waiting on the person it is talking to.

When a notification is delivered, the message lands in the recipient's own
thread. Their next message is very often the answer — but the agent handling it
has no idea a question is outstanding, and no idea what the asker wanted done
with the reply. Without this capability the reply is just chat: nothing comes
back, and the asking run waits for something that will never arrive.

So this injects, at run assembly, the open asks on this conversation: what was
sent, and the ``background_instruction`` the asker wrote — which the recipient
never sees, and which is the only place the asker can say "record their status
update" or "write the PO number into purchase_orders".

Instructions, not a tool call, because the agent has to know *before* it decides
how to reply. A tool it must remember to call first is a tool it will sometimes
not call, and the failure is silent.

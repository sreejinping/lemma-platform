"""What the person said while the agent was already working.

A message sent mid-run joins the run in flight, which loaded its history before
that message existed. Nothing carried it any further, so it sat unanswered until
the person happened to send another one -- and on a chat surface, where one
message is routinely delivered as several webhooks, "another one" was often the
rest of the same sentence. Three photos and the question they were about became
one run that answered the photos and three messages nobody read.

Pydantic AI already has the seam: ``ctx.enqueue`` puts content into the run, and
the framework's own outermost capability drains it into the next model request
-- or, if the agent would otherwise finish, redirects it into one more request.
So the fix is not another run. It is telling the run that is already going.

Enqueued at ``'asap'`` (the default) and as **user content**, never as a
``SystemPromptPart``: this is a webhook payload, and a system prompt carries
operator authority that an injection buried in someone's message must not
inherit.

The hook is ``before_node_run`` rather than ``before_model_request`` on purpose.
The framework's drain is ordered outermost, so its ``before_model_request`` has
already run by the time ours would -- content enqueued there waits for the
*next* request. Enqueuing a node earlier lands it in the request about to be
built, which is what makes a burst of bubbles arrive as one turn.

"""Map Agent Host events onto the existing runtime event stream.

Events arrive on one ordered per-run Redis Stream, so this applies them in
order and never reconciles two sources. The previous two-lane design needed an
authoritative-sequence map, a per-stream sealed-length counter, and a
``startswith`` delta repair purely to survive a lossy chunk lane writing into
the same accumulated text as the durable lane. None of that exists here: with a
single ordered lane, a chunk cannot arrive after the upsert that supersedes it.

Every event arrives already normalized (docs/architecture/agent-host-events.md).
The host knows which adapter and which pinned version it is running, so it names
each tool, shapes its input and output, and says whose tool it is. This module
used to do that itself from raw ACP payloads, and guessed: every Codex MCP call
became ``exec_command``, Claude Code's ``Bash`` never did, and every
``usage_update`` was billed as a request with zero tokens. What is left here is
*mapping*, one event to its messages, plus the conversation-level behaviours
only this side can own: sealing narration, flushing thought per step, finding
the final answer, and closing what a run leaves open.

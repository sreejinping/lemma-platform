"""How long a dispatched Agent Host run may live, and how it ends.

Three separate ceilings decide a run's real lifetime, and they used to
disagree: the worker task that drives it, the credential encrypted into its

the one number they now agree on and the reasoning behind it, so a change to
any of them has a single obvious place to land.

# The deadline we hand the host, and therefore the real lifetime of the run.
#
# This was 50 minutes, and the reason given was the MCP credential encrypted
# into START_RUN: the SuperTokens core issues it with a one-hour validity, and
# "nothing refreshes" it. Something does now -- `refresh_credential` mints a
# replacement and sends it to the host as a command, on the margin below -- so
# the credential stopped being the ceiling and the 50 minutes outlived its own
# justification. What it cost was an agent working steadily on a real task
# being killed at minute fifty with "run deadline elapsed", which is a system
# failure wearing the clothes of a policy.
#
# A long deadline is safe because it is not what detects a host that has gone
# away. The run lease is 90 seconds and is checked every 5, so a host that
# crashed, slept or lost its network is failed inside two minutes no matter how
# far off the deadline is. The deadline exists only to bound a host that is
# still answering and still working.
#
# What it must still sit inside:
#
#   * the worker task that drives the harness
#     (AGENT_RUN_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS). Past that, streaq cancels the job and
#     Lemma reports the run failed -- so a deadline beyond it is one we cannot
#     honour, and the host would keep executing a run we have given up on;
#   * comfortably above the host's 30-minute permission window, so a permission
#     parked mid-run can still be answered before the run is over.

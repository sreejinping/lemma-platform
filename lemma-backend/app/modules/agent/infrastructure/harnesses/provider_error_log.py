"""Server-side diagnostics for provider HTTP failures.

Production logged only the status code, which made these undiagnosable: a week
of 400s could be a context overflow, a malformed tool schema, or an image sent
to a text-only model, and nothing distinguished them.

The obvious fix — log the response body — is forbidden here, and rightly: the
logging contract (`app/core/log/log.py::_PROHIBITED_FIELDS`) bans `body`,
`message`, `headers` and friends because provider errors echo the request, keys
included. So instead of the body we extract the two short, enum-like identifiers
every provider puts beside the prose:

    OpenAI-compatible: {"error": {"type": "invalid_request_error",
                                  "code": "context_length_exceeded", ...}}
    Anthropic:         {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "invalid_request_error"}}

Those are the fields that actually separate one 400 from another, and they carry
no user or credential data. Anything that isn't a short identifier is dropped
rather than truncated — a value long enough to be prose is prose.

# validation feedback before the run gives up. Execution errors are handled
# separately by GracefulToolset and never consume this budget.

"""Rebuild a pydantic-ai conversation from Lemma's persisted messages.

Kept apart from the harness because it is a pure transform with no runtime
state: given the message rows, it produces the ``ModelMessage`` history and the
user prompt for the next turn. Its one subtle rule is tool pairing — a tool call
without its matching return is dropped rather than sent, because a model
rejects a call it never saw answered.

Reasoning has a rule of its own, and it lives in `pydantic_ai_thinking`
beside the credential check it depends on.

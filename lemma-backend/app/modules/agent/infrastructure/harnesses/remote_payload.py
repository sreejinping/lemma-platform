    would only duplicate the conversation in its context.

    A run that resumes a pause is the same rule with a different answer. Waking
    from a ``wait_for`` adds no user message, so "the latest user message" is the
    request that started the task — and re-sending that to an agent whose
    session already contains it does not read as "carry on", it reads as the

    genuinely not seen is the return Lemma synthesized for the call it paused
    on, which is exactly what resuming has to deliver.

    The other exception is a run that is not going to try: a harness that never
    advertised ``loadSession`` has no session to resume, ever. Sending one lone
    message there leaves the agent answering a follow-up it has never seen the
    start of. This costs nothing in the usual case, because a resumable harness
    only lacks a stored session on a conversation's first turn, where there is
    no history to send.

    And a turn answers every message that is its own, not only the newest: the
    one that started it, any that arrived before it was dispatched, and -- for
    a follow-up turn -- everything the person said while the previous turn was
    working, which the follow-up claims (``steered_into_run``). "The latest
    user message" alone answered the last of three and dropped the other two on

"""Messages sent while a run was working, and who has delivered them.

The predicate every party agrees on, and the three writes the Agent Host's
steering added: marking a message as on its way to a host, recording what the
host said, and withdrawing one nobody is carrying yet. Counting and claiming
stay on ``ConversationRepository``, which the turn coordinator reaches through
its port; these have their own repository, because only the harness and the
withdraw route ask for them. All of it is about the metadata keys in
``domain/queued_messages.py``.

Every write here is one ``UPDATE ... RETURNING`` (or ``DELETE ... RETURNING``)
whose ``WHERE`` restates the state it moves the message out of. That is what
makes each transition happen at most once when two parties race for the same
message -- the in-process capability and the follow-up turn, a host reporting a
steer and the person withdrawing it -- without anything taking a lock.

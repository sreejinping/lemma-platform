"""Applying what a host reports about its runs: acks, checkpoints, rejections.

Plain functions over a session, following ``agent_host_recovery`` and
``agent_host_event_intake``: one caller, no polymorphism to add.

Every rule here exists because delivery is at-least-once and the host only
clears its outbox once we accept an update. Anything we refuse is something
it resends forever, and the ``control`` frame carrying these updates is also
the heartbeat that keeps that host's link alive and the moment its commands are
read -- so a stale update must be a no-op, never an error, and never a reason
to fail the frame around it.

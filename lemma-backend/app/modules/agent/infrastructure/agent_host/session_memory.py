"""Which provider session a conversation is talking to.

One Lemma conversation is one Codex/Claude Code/OpenCode session. Without that,
the agent meets the user again on every message: it cannot see what it just
said, so it re-asks answered questions and contradicts itself.

The host opens a session and reports its id on the checkpoint it writes just
before dispatching the prompt; that id is stored against the conversation, and
every later turn is dispatched with it so the agent loads its own history back.
Both halves live here so the read and the write cannot drift apart.

"""Re-aiming a queued START_RUN at the harness revision that exists now.

A dispatched run carries the harness ``config_revision`` that was current when
it was enqueued, and the host refuses any command naming a revision it has
since replaced. That refusal is correct -- the command describes a
configuration the machine no longer has -- but it is not a reason to lose the
run, because the host re-publishes for reasons that have nothing to do with the
person who pressed send: a 15-minute refresh, a coding agent updating itself, a
publish that failed during a backend restart and landed a minute later.

The obvious repair is to mark the rejection retryable, and it is a trap. The
poll hands back whatever is ``QUEUED``, verbatim; nothing re-mints a payload,
and ``AgentHostCommandModel`` has no attempt counter. A command requeued with
the same stale revision is refused again a second later, and again, until its
TTL expires -- a spin, instead of a fast failure.

So this module rewrites the payload before the command goes back on the queue,
and counts its own attempts inside the ``rejection`` JSONB the command already
carries.

One shape of stale rejection is deliberately *not* repaired here, because it
is not ours to repair. The host applies a publish only when it drains the
channel that publish arrived on, and it used to drain only at the top of a
loop iteration -- so a run could be refused as superseded while naming the
newest revision, with the host's own copy the older of the two. Lemma and the
host agreed; only the host's memory was behind, which is invisible from here
and reads exactly like a genuine disagreement. Requeuing on that guess would
resend an identical payload the host refuses again, which is the spin
described above. It is fixed where it happens, in the Agent Host's
``sync_harnesses_for_commands``, and the fence there now also asks the host to
publish again immediately rather than waiting out its refresh interval.

"""The per-host notice channel every live Agent Host link subscribes to.

A host's link subscribes to this one channel once, for as long as the socket is
open, and three kinds of notice travel on it:

``poke``
    A command was queued for this host. The link that holds its socket re-reads
    the queue and pushes what it finds. A pure latency optimization: the link
    also re-reads every 5 seconds, so a lost poke costs a few seconds and never
    correctness. That is why publishing is best effort and never raises.
``superseded``
    A newer link for this host said ``hello``. It carries the link generation
    that ``hello`` claimed in the database, and every link holding a smaller
    one closes with 4409, so commands go out on one socket at a time even when
    a network drop left a half-open one behind on another replica. The
    generation, not the connection id, is what decides: two handshakes racing
    each hear the other's notice, and "any other connection id is newer" closed
    both of them.
``revoked``
    The user revoked the host. Its secret is already dead in the database; this
    closes the socket that authenticated with it before the revocation, which
    would otherwise stay open until the host next reconnected.
``op``
    An operation inside a host workspace (host execution, see
    docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md). It names a one-off reply
    channel; the link holding the socket forwards it to the host as an ``op``
    frame and publishes the answer there. Unlike a poke it is not best effort
    for the caller -- it waits on the reply channel -- but it is still safe to
    lose: a caller that hears nothing within ``OP_PICKUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``
    reports the host offline, and nothing ran.

Redis pub/sub, so any API replica can reach the one holding the socket without a
routing table. Run events do not travel here: they go to the run's Redis Stream,
which is ordered and replayable, and this channel is neither.

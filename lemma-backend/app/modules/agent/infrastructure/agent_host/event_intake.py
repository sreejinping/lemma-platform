"""Accepting one ordered batch of run events from an Agent Host.

A plain function over a session and a stream, following the same shape as
``agent_host_recovery``: it has one caller, so wrapping it in a class would add
indirection without adding polymorphism.

The rules it enforces are the whole reason at-least-once delivery is safe here.
Everything else about a run is a row write; this path deliberately is not.

    """Append one ordered batch to the run's stream.

    Deliberately performs no row write, and deliberately takes no row lock. The
    lease is read only to answer three questions -- is this host allowed to
    write here, is its epoch current, and has the run already ended -- none of
    which it then mutates. Locking it used to be how concurrent batches for one
    run were serialized, which meant holding a row lock and a pooled database
    connection across two Redis round trips with a 15s socket timeout. That
    ordering guarantee now lives in the stream's own atomic append, next to the
    watermark it is about.

    An *empty* stream is treated as a lost stream, not as a run that has emitted
    nothing. The host deletes each event from its own outbox once we ack it, so
    after a Redis flush its oldest surviving event is whatever it had not yet
    sent -- far above sequence 1. Demanding 1 there rejects every batch the host
    has left, forever, and the run produces no output at all. We adopt its
    oldest surviving sequence instead and lose only the events that were already
    gone. A stream that still holds entries keeps strict gap detection, where a
    gap really does mean loss in flight.

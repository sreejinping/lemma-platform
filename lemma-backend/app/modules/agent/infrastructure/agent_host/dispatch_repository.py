"""Dispatch state for Agent Host: commands, run leases, and event intake.

Transport delivery is intentionally at-least-once. This repository enforces the
durable fencing and acceptance rules that make replay safe across API and host
restarts.

Two things live in PostgreSQL because they need guarantees Redis does not give
cheaply: the command queue depends on ``SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` so
concurrent API replicas never hand one command to two pollers, and the run
lease is keyed by ``run_id`` as its primary key, which is what makes
double-dispatch structurally impossible rather than merely guarded in code.

Run *events* are not stored here at all. They go to the run's Redis Stream, so
appending a batch performs no row write: the lease is read under a row lock
purely to serialize concurrent batches and validate the epoch, and the ack
watermark comes from the stream's last entry.

One consequence of at-least-once delivery shapes everything the host reports
up: a control update the backend rejects is a control update the host resends
forever, because it only clears its outbox once we accept it. Anything that
travels on the link's ``control`` frame — acknowledgements, checkpoints,
rejections — must therefore be a no-op when it is stale rather than an error,
and a single bad one must not fail the frame that carries the rest. A frame
answered with an error delivers no commands at all, so one un-appliable
checkpoint would otherwise stop CANCEL_RUN and RESOLVE_PERMISSION reaching that
host for every run it is executing.

"Poll" below means one read of the command queue: the link reads it whenever
it applies a ``control`` frame, whenever the host's channel is poked, and every
5 seconds as the floor under a lost poke (see ``agent_host_link_session``).

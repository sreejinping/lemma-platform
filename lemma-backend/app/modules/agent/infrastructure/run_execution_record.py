"""Where a run's commands execute, written on the run itself.

docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md §2: the choice is made once and a
run never moves. The context that carries it is rebuilt whenever the run is --
a worker reclaiming it after a crash, an approved tool being executed after a
pause -- so the choice has to live somewhere those can read it back. It lives
under one key of the run's own metadata, written with ``jsonb_set`` so no
other key is disturbed.

The same record is what a host sandbox's operations are routed by: a run's
own operations go to the host it recorded, and an operation no run is making
goes to the host the conversation's most recent host run chose
(``latest_host_execution``), so there is no table saying so separately.

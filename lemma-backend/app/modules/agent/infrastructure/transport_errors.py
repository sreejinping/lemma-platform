"""Which model-request failures are worth another attempt.

A provider that drops the SSE stream mid-response used to kill the whole
conversation run: the exception unwound past the graph into the harness's
catch-all and the user got "something went wrong" with no way back. Those drops
are transient by nature — the request was accepted, the connection died — so the
run can be resumed from the messages already recorded.

The distinction that matters is *transient transport* versus *the provider told
us something*. A 400 means the request is wrong, a 402 means the account is out
of credit, a 404 means the model doesn't exist: retrying any of them just burns
the same failure three times and delays the error the user needs to see. Only
connection-level failures and the handful of status codes that explicitly mean
"try again" are retried.

Mirrors the spirit of ``tools.tool_errors.is_control_flow_exception``: a small,
explicit allowlist, biased towards *not* retrying when unsure.

"""The backstop for messages no run ever read.

A message sent mid-run joins the run already in flight, which loaded its history
before that message existed. `PendingUserMessagesCapability` is what normally
carries it the rest of the way — it claims the message and steers it into that
same run, so one reply covers everything and nothing reaches here.

An Agent Host run is steered too, when its harness advertises ACP steering (see
`harnesses/agent_host/steering.py`). This exists for what neither can cover: a
harness that cannot steer, a steer that did not land before the turn ended, and
a run that died before draining its queue. Each leaves a person waiting on an
answer that will otherwise never come.

Hung off `agent.run.completed` rather than off the end of the runner because
every way a run can end publishes that event: a normal finish, a failure, and
the cron that reconciles runs whose worker died. A run stopped on purpose is the
one exclusion, and it is made here.

Lives in the events layer because it is composition — it builds a service out of
a worker's unit of work — and because `handlers` is against the file-size
ratchet.

"""Connector toolset: call an installed connector's operations directly.

Agents previously reached connectors only by shelling out to `lemma connectors
operations ...` inside the sandbox. That works, and still does, but it costs a
sandbox round trip per call and is unavailable to any agent without the
workspace toolset.

The loop is search, describe, run: an org can have thousands of operations once
a couple of MCP servers are installed, so operations are found rather than
enumerated, and their schemas are fetched on demand rather than compiled into
per-operation tools.

Arguments are validated here against the operation's own stored schema, and a
mismatch comes back as a structured result rather than an exception, so the
model can correct itself instead of the run failing.

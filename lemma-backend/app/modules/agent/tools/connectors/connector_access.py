"""Authorized, in-process access to connector operations for agent tools.

Agents previously reached connectors only by shelling out to the `lemma` CLI
inside the sandbox, which meant an operation call cost a sandbox round trip and
an HTTP hop, and was unavailable to any agent without the workspace toolset.

This binds the same services the HTTP route uses to the agent's delegated
authorization context, built exactly as the pod toolset builds it. The point is
that ``AccountResolutionService`` still makes every authorization decision --
``connector.use`` for the connector, ``connector_account.use`` to borrow someone
else's account -- so there is one implementation of those rules, not a second
one that can drift.

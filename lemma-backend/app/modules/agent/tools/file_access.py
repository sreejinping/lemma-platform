"""Dual-store file reads for agent tools.

The pod datastore (``/me/...`` and other pod-visible paths) is the source of
truth for user-facing files; the workspace sandbox (an absolute path under the
sandbox home, or one relative to the conversation cwd) is the agent's ephemeral
working area. Tools
that read a file should target the store they mean: ``read_pod_file_bytes`` for
the datastore (grant-checked) and ``read_workspace_file_bytes`` for the sandbox.

Some tools (speech ``listen``) accept a single user-supplied path and infer the
store from its shape via ``read_agent_file_bytes`` / ``is_datastore_path``; tools
that already know the store (view-image) call the explicit readers directly so
there is no ambiguous path-shape routing.

Writes are intentionally NOT bridged: user-facing artifacts are written to the
datastore via ``DatastoreFileService.create_file`` (the same path the lemma CLI
uses); scratch files stay in the sandbox via ``file_manager.write_file``.

    never ran. A Telegram photo -- saved as bare ``photo``, because the platform
    sends neither a filename nor a type -- reached `view_image` as

    Absolute paths (``/me/...`` and other pod-visible roots) are datastore
    paths; anything under a runtime filesystem root -- the sandbox user's home
    and ``/tmp`` -- and every relative path belong to the sandbox.

    The roots are read from `RUNTIME_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS` rather than spelled here,
    because the default when a path matches nothing is to route it at the pod:
    a root this list forgot does not fail, it silently addresses the wrong disk.

    The path is normalised first, so the prefix being compared is the one the
    path actually names: `/tmp/../me/report` reads as `/me/report` and goes to
    the pod, where a raw prefix check saw `/tmp/` and sent it to the sandbox.
    Lexical only, deliberately -- symlinks are resolved by the containment clamp
    on the sandbox side, which is where the filesystem to resolve them against
    actually is.

    Leading slashes collapse before that, because `normpath` will not do it:
    POSIX leaves exactly two implementation-defined, so `//tmp/x` survives while
    `///tmp/x` becomes `/tmp/x`. Joining a cwd that ends in `/` to an absolute
    name produces precisely that doubled form, and it named the sandbox.

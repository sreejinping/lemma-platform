"""The voices a provider actually has, read from the provider.

`deepgram_provider` used to carry one hand-picked voice per language in a dict.
Aura-2 ships roughly eighty across seven languages, each with an accent, an age
and use-case tags, so the dict was both a tiny slice of what exists and a thing
that goes stale on its own — which the provider's own 400-on-a-retired-voice
fallback was there to survive.

Reading the catalogue removes both problems, and it is the only honest source:
while writing this, two of Deepgram's own documentation pages disagreed about
which languages Aura-2 covers. The API does not have opinions.

Cached in Redis, per this codebase's rule that data caching goes through
`RedisJsonCache` and never an in-process dict: an API key is per-deployment, and
a per-process copy would mean each worker holding its own slightly different
idea of what voices exist.

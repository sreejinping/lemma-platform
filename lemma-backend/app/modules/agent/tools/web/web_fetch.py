"""Capture web pages into the agent's workspace.

The capability already existed — `save-webpage` drives a headed
Chrome in the sandbox and emits Readability→Turndown markdown, a PDF, and
full-page screenshots — but it was reachable only by `exec_command` and
advertised in ten lines of prose, one URL at a time. Research means reading ten
sources, so it is a tool now, and it takes a list.

Two paths, because they cost very differently:

* **http** (default) — fetched and reduced to clean markdown in this process by
  `page_extract`, then written to the workspace. No browser start-up and no
  container round-trip to fetch, so it is fast; and because boilerplate is
  stripped before anything is stored, raw HTML never reaches the agent.
* **browser** — `save-webpage` in the sandbox, for pages that only exist after
  JavaScript runs and for any request that wants a PDF or screenshot.

Both write into the workspace and return *paths plus a preview*, never the page
text. That is the whole point: twenty pages of article text would swamp the
context this tool exists to protect. The agent greps what it saved, `view_image`s
a screenshot, or runs `pod_view_document_pages` over a captured PDF.

Fetches on the http path run concurrently — they are independent network waits,
and a research batch is the case this tool was built for. The browser path stays
serialised on purpose, and that was re-measured rather than inherited. Every
`agent-browser` command acts on its session's *active* tab -- `--session` can
be targeted, a tab cannot -- so two captures sharing a session read each
other's page. Giving each its own session sidesteps that and costs a cold
Chrome apiece: measured on 1 vCPU / 2 GB, three pages, byte-identical
markdown either way, serial 11.0s against parallel 75.4s.

Memory is not the constraint, whatever the RSS sums elsewhere suggest: five
concurrent tabs in one browser peaked at 1656 MiB of a 2048 MiB cgroup. The
one vCPU is.

A whole-batch deadline bounds the pathological case where most of the list
needs rendering.

Every URL is checked against `assert_safe_url` before *either* path runs. The
in-process fetch reaches the network from the backend, and the browser reaches
it from inside the sandbox, so a check on only one of them would leave the other
as a way to the metadata service. What makes the cheap path win more often is
`impersonating_client`, which wears a real Chrome TLS fingerprint — sites decide
during the handshake, long before they read a `User-Agent`.

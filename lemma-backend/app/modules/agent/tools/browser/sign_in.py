"""Getting the agent past a login wall by asking the person.

The shape of this tool is the whole point. It does not hand the model a link and
tell it to wait -- that is what the first version did, and nothing resumed the
run, so the agent's only option was to end its turn and hope. Here the tool
*pauses*, exactly the way `ask_user` and `request_approval` do: the call is
persisted, the conversation goes to WAITING, and the person's answer starts a
fresh run that replays this call's return.

That also means the ask reaches the person wherever they are, with no work here:
a waiting conversation already renders as a card in the web app and as native
buttons on WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram and email.

The model never sees a password and is never asked to type one. It names a site;
the person signs in themselves in the browser; what comes back is whether that
worked.

Authorization is built here rather than inherited. `resolve_owner` reads the
ambient context when it is given none, and an agent run has none: the contextvar
is set by an HTTP request dependency, and a tool call comes off a queue. So
every call from here was refused with "No authorization context" -- the agent
did the right thing and reported that it could not ask, which is not a thing a
person can act on. The delegated context is the same one the connector tools and
the GitHub bridge build, so the rule about whose login a run may use has one
implementation.

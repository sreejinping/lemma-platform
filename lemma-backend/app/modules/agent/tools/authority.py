"""Whose authority an agent tool call runs with. One answer, in one place.

There are exactly two:

* **The agent's own.** A delegated workload context: the agent's resource
  grants, intersected with what the person it works for may do. Anything
  beyond that -- a missing grant, a destructive action, an auth-required step
  -- is refused with a code the tool turns into ``needs_approval``.
* **The person's, lent for one approved call.** When a person approves a
  ``request_approval``, that exact call runs as them: their own permissions,
  nothing more, and the destructive-action gate is satisfied because a person
  approved it at the time (PS-ACCESS-021). Nothing is left behind -- the
  agent's next call is judged on its own grants again.

Every tool family used to build its own delegated context from
``deps.workload_id or DEFAULT_POD_AGENT_ID``, and the approval executor relied
on stripping ``workload_id`` to make those builders "act as the user". #597
changed how the builders recognise the pod's own assistant, and from then on an
approved call from a named agent was authorised as a placeholder agent with no
grants: every approval failed with ``MISSING_WORKLOAD_RESOURCE_GRANT``. Making
the approval an explicit value (``ApprovedExecution``) and deciding here is
what keeps that from recurring; ``test_tool_authority`` fails if any agent
module builds a delegated context itself.

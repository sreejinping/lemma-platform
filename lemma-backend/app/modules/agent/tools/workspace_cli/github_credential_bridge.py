"""Session-scoped GitHub credential delivery for `git`/`gh` CLI use in a workspace.

Every other connector's credential is used exclusively through the in-process
tool-call proxy (`agent/tools/connectors/`): the account is resolved and the
raw token is used server-side to make one HTTP call, and it never enters the
sandbox. That doesn't work for `git`/`gh`, which are open-ended shell tools --
the credential material has to actually be present inside the sandbox for the
shell to use it.

This mirrors the workspace module's own existing pattern for its own
delegated identity token (`WorkspaceSandboxService.get_env_vars` mints a
short-lived `LEMMA_TOKEN` once per session) and the sandbox runtime's stated design
principle that dynamic credentials belong to a session, never to a sandbox's
persisted profile: the token is written once per session into `/tmp` (which
does not survive a workspace recreation, unlike the durable home
volume), re-provisioned periodically rather than trusted forever, and never
returned to the caller, logged, or placed in a tool-result string.

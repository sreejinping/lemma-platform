    Show a pod resource or a rendered view to the user.

    Reach for this whenever the useful answer is more than short prose: several
    values, records, statuses, comparisons, a timeline, or a chart render as a
    WIDGET. After creating or changing a pod resource, display it.

    Set `type` and, for most types, a `name` — omit `name` to show all resources
    of that type. FILE takes a pod `path`, so upload sandbox deliverables with
    `lemma files upload` first; a workspace path is not pod-visible. WIDGET takes
    exactly one of `path`, `content`, or `public_url`; load the `lemma-widget`
    skill before your first widget. React, routing, or real state means an app.

    A WIDGET is a live view, not a picture: it reads pod data through the browser
    SDK, filters and opens records in place, and can offer the person their next
    question in the composer. It cannot send one — `ask_user` is for an answer
    this run needs.

    Give a WIDGET a `path`: write its HTML to a pod file with `pod_write_file`
    (`/me/c/<date>/<name>.html`) and display that. The widget serves whatever the
    file says, so correcting one is an edit to the file. `content` inlines the
    HTML instead and freezes it in this call.

    A display that succeeds is already in front of the person. Nothing here
    replaces or edits an earlier one, so calling again adds a second resource
    below the first rather than correcting it — which is the other reason to
    keep the HTML in a file.

    This tool displays. `ask_user` collects choices, `request_approval` collects
    permission.

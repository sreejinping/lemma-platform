        gets them from its open-notifications capability instead, so it leaves
        this off rather than see them twice. ``harness_kind`` decides it for
        the runner: any harness but the in-process one is served over MCP.

        ``host_execution`` is set on a run whose commands execute on the

          the coding agent already has a shell and file tools in the same
          folder on the same Mac, and two tools that do one thing in one place
          only confuse the model.
        * ``"sandbox"`` -- an in-process run whose ``exec_command`` runs on the

        ``agent-browser`` was reached through the shell that is now elsewhere,
        so an agent that had the workspace CLI gets the ``browser`` tool in its
        place. Pod, connectors, ``ask_user``, ``display_resource`` and the rest
        stay.

        ``grants`` lets a caller that already loaded the agent's grant summary
        (the runner does, to build its context brief) hand it over instead of
        paying for the same query twice. Callers without one -- the MCP server

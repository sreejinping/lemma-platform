"""The pod datastore's file half: write, list, read, render, link, search.

Separated from the table tools because they answer different questions and fail
differently. A table read is a query; a file read is a fetch that may be a PDF
the model cannot see, in which case `pod_view_document_pages` either hands the
model images directly or -- when the model has no vision -- delegates to one
that does and returns a description instead.

`pod_get_file_url` is the one to read carefully: it hands out a URL, so what it
returns is reachable by whoever the agent shows it to.

"""Durable user-approval reconciliation.

Resolving an approval is two steps with very different costs: recording the
user's decision is a single row write, while acting on it can run an approved
command for minutes or hand a decision to a remote Agent Host. Callers that sit
behind a deadline — an HTTP request, a platform webhook — must only ever pay for
the first. This module owns the pieces that let them do that: the deterministic
job identity, the queueing, and the work the queued job performs.

    The dispatch is deferred to ``after_commit`` and the message is written
    optimistically. That is a deliberate trade, made knowingly: it used to await
    the dispatch and branch on the result, which meant a Redis publish and a
    second session ran inside the caller's open write transaction, holding a

    asynchronous by nature and the wording never claimed delivery, so the
    transcript stays truthful; the run-already-ended case is rare and is handled
    anyway by `reconcile_agent_host_dispatch`, which cancels orphaned runs.

    ``executed`` stays False, unlike the ordinary request_approval path. It means
    "the wrapped tool ran", and on this path Lemma runs nothing: it queues a
    decision for a machine that will collect it on its next poll, and the ACP

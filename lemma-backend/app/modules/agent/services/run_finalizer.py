"""Writing a run's terminal state, come what may.

Every path out of a run ends here: the harness reported a terminal event, or it
raised, or the worker was cancelled mid-answer. All three have to leave the same
durable record, because a run whose row still says RUNNING is a run nobody can
retry and nobody can bill.

Separated from the runner because "decide what happened" and "record what
happened" fail differently. The recording half is the one that must survive
cancellation, and the shielding that lets it do so — see `finalize_safely` and
its caller — is subtle enough to deserve its own file rather than being the tail
of a 350-line method.

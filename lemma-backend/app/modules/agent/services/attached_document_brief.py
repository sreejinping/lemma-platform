"""The doc a conversation is attached to, as it reads right now.

A conversation opened beside a doc is about that doc: nearly every turn in it
asks about the text or changes it. Without this section each of those turns
spends its first step reading the file, which is a full model round trip spent
learning something the platform already knew. The text is read fresh on every
run -- the person edits the page between turns, and the agent edits it within
one -- and is placed after everything cacheable in the prompt.

The path comes from conversation metadata the client sets when it binds the
conversation to a file. It is read as the user, so an attachment never shows
the agent a file the person could not open themselves.

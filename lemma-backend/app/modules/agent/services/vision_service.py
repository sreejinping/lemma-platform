"""Let an agent on a text-only model still look at something.

A separate vision model reads the image and reports what it sees in words. The
calling agent's own history therefore never contains image content, which is
what makes this safe on a text-only model — the failure it replaces is a
provider 400 when `BinaryContent` reaches a model that cannot accept it.

Fallback policy is deliberately the opposite of `conversation_title_service`'s:
titles fall back to the profile default, vision must not. Falling back here
would resolve to the same text-only model that created the problem, and the
400 would come back wearing a different hat. If no vision-capable model is
configured, the tool says so.

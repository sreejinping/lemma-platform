"""The database half of the Agent Host link: one short transaction per frame.

A link lives for hours, and a transaction must never live across an await on
the socket. So nothing here is handed a unit of work; each method opens its own,
does its repository work, commits, and returns plain values. The session calls
these between frames and holds no database connection while it waits for the
next one -- which is also why this is a separate object: the session can be
tested against a stand-in without a database, and the rules a stand-in would
otherwise have to copy stay in the repositories they already lived in.

Everything the HTTP device routes did is here, one method each, with the same
repository calls. The link moved the transport and kept every rule.

"""Auto-generate a short title for a conversation.

Triggered after the first agent run completes (see
``app/modules/agent/events/handlers.py``). Generation is idempotent: it only
runs while ``conversation.title`` is unset, so a user-supplied title is never
overwritten.

By default the title is derived directly from the user's first message — no LLM
call, so titling is instant and adds no model load or DB-connection pressure.
A deployment can opt into LLM-generated titles by setting
``CONVERSATION_TITLE_MODEL`` to a model its provider actually serves; if that
call fails we still fall back to the first-message title.

One attempt per conversation, and no retry: the job carries a deterministic id
so it runs once, and a fallback title is an acceptable outcome. What is *not*
acceptable is not knowing which of the two ran — a failure here is logged at
``error`` with its traceback and counted on
``lemma.agent.conversation_titles``. It stays non-fatal, because titling must
never break the worker that invokes it, but non-fatal is not the same as silent.

    The system prompt asks for this and mostly gets it, but "mostly" is not a
    property a title has: a conversation opened with "hi" came back titled
    初识寒暄, and the person who opened it had no way to fix it short of renaming
    the thread. Prompts are best-effort; this is the part that holds.

    A title using no script of its own (Latin, digits, punctuation) always
    passes -- that is the documented default. A title in Han characters passes
    only if the user wrote in Han characters too.

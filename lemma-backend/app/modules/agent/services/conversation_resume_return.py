"""Turning a resolved approval into the tool result the agent will read.

When a person answers an `ask_user` or decides a `request_approval`, the paused
run is already over. Resuming means writing the tool return that run never got,
so the *next* run reads a complete tool call rather than a dangling one -- which
is the only shape pydantic-ai will accept as history.

Three shapes come out of here, and which one depends on what was paused:

* `ask_user` -- the answers, or a dismissal.
* a host permission request -- handed back to the ACP agent that is still
  blocked on it, denials included, or its run sits until the request times out.
* `request_approval` -- and this is the one with teeth, because an approval
  actually *runs* the inner tool, as the user rather than as the agent. That
  principal switch is the whole point of the approval: the agent was refused,
  the person was not.

Split out of `ConversationService` because it is the part with the most branches
and the least to do with conversations -- it needs a unit of work and an agent
repository, and nothing else the service holds.

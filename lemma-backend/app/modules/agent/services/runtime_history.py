"""What history reaches the model, and how much of a run survives the trip.

Two policies live here, and both apply to every conversation the same way --
where a conversation came from (web, task, Slack, WhatsApp, ...) never changes
what the model is shown. Only the newest ``MAX_HISTORY_AGENT_RUNS`` runs are
carried at all, and everything older than the most recent few is collapsed to
what still matters (every user message, the closing answer) with a notice saying
how many runs were dropped.

Runs are read through ``AgentRun.message_count`` rather than by counting what is
loaded: the runtime history loader deliberately fetches older runs down to two
messages, so ``len(run.messages)`` is not how big the run was.

Extracted from the runner because it is policy about the prompt rather than
mechanics of executing a run -- and because the runner is at the architecture
ratchet's size limit.

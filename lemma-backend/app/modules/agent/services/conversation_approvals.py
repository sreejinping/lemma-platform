"""Resolving a pause: recording the decision, then unblocking the run.

A pausing tool call ends its run and leaves a dangling tool call behind. What
resolves it -- a person clicking Approve, a typed reply arriving from Slack, a
newer message superseding an unanswered question -- all lands here, and all of
it has to be idempotent, because every one of those paths can be retried.

Three things are idempotent for three different reasons, and they are the
substance of this module:

* The **decision** is guarded by a unique ``(conversation_id, approval_id)`` row.
  That constraint is the double-submit lock; a second click adopts the first
  decision rather than recording a new one.
* The **tool return** is guarded by checking for an existing return before
  building one. This is the one that matters most: building an approved
  ``request_approval`` return *runs the wrapped tool*, so a second build would
  re-deploy the app or re-run the command.
* The **resume run** is guarded by the conversation lock plus a check that every
  pausing call in the paused run is now resolved, so two near-simultaneous
  resolves start one run between them, not two.

A resolve that dies halfway -- decision written, return not appended, run not
started -- self-heals the next time the user retries, because each half checks
for its own effect before doing it again.

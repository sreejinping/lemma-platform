"""Starting and stopping a turn.

A turn is one user message plus the run that answers it. Starting one is mostly
a question of *whether* to start a run at all -- a message typed while a run is
already going joins that run instead of racing a second one -- and the answer
has to be decided under the conversation lock, because two browser tabs asking
at once must not each get a run.

Stopping is the same question in reverse, and the asymmetry is deliberate: a
stop closes any pause the run was sitting on, but never starts the resume run
that closing a pause normally triggers. Stop means stop.

Split from `ConversationService` because this is the part with the lock, the
ordering constraints and the outbox; the rest of that class is storage.

        connection -- and unlike `start`, whose caller commits again later and
        drains `after_commit`, the caller here is a worker job with no second
        commit to hang them on.

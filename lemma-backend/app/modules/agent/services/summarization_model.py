"""Resolve the model that compacts conversation history.

Compaction defaulted to the run's own model, so every compaction was a ~70k-token
request on the most expensive model in play — and, because the summarizer builds
a bare `Agent` internally, one that Lemma never metered. Pointing this at a small
fast model is usually strictly better: summarising a transcript is not the task
the expensive model was chosen for.

Falls back to the run's model when nothing is configured or the configured name
is not in this deployment's catalog, so a bad value degrades to today's
behaviour instead of breaking every long conversation.

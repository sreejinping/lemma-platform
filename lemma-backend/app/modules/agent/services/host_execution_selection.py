"""Whether a run executes on the Mac of the user it runs for. Decided once per run.

See docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md §2. There is no installation
owner: a run is routed by the **Agent Host pairing**. It gets host execution
only when **all** of these hold, and otherwise the VM sandbox, exactly as
before:

1. this is a Desktop local install (the backend runs beside the hosts it
   would route to; a hosted deployment never routes a run to a machine);
2. the run acts as the conversation's user -- the workspace is theirs;
3. the run's triggering human is that user, in Lemma's own app (below);
4. that user -- the one the host is paired to -- has an online Agent Host
   with host execution on and available, and it opens the workspace when
   asked. With several, the one the conversation last ran on, else the most
   recently seen (``host_execution_host_id``).

A host is paired to exactly one user, and only that user's runs are ever
routed to it: somebody else's run on the same installation goes to their own
host if they have one, or to the VM.

**Who triggered the run.** A conversation here belongs to one user, and every
run in it runs as that user, so (2) already names the only human who can type
into it. What remains is *how* the run started. Only a person in Lemma's own
app qualifies: a message, a retry, an answer to a question or an approval, or
the queued follow-up of messages they sent. A ``wait_for`` waking qualifies
only when the work it continues was started that way: the runs before it are
walked back past other wakes, and the first one that is not a wake has to be
one of those person sources. Nothing a schedule or a workflow started does,
whatever later runs in its conversation were: a conversation that carries a
``source`` in its metadata (a workflow run, a schedule, a surface, a
notification) or a ``workflow_run_id`` was not opened by a person in the app,
so no run in it executes on the host. A teammate's reply to a message the
agent sent (``message_replies``) does not qualify either: somebody else's
words would drive commands on the user's Mac. Nothing that arrived on a
channel does: a Slack or email or Telegram sender is the platform's
assertion, not the user's session, so an inbound channel run never executes
on the host, whoever it resolved to. Sub-agent conversations never do either.
An unknown source does not qualify -- a new source has to be added here on
purpose.

**Once.** The check runs the first time the run's context is built, and the
answer -- host or VM, and for the host which Mac and which folder -- is
written on the run (``run_execution_record``). A
context rebuilt for the same run -- a worker reclaiming it, an approved tool
executing after a pause -- reads that answer back instead of deciding again,
so a run never moves. The host sandbox's id records the fabric, so its
operations can only ever go to the host, and the record names the host, so
they go to that one; a host that goes away mid-run fails the next operation
with "This Mac is not connected", and nothing falls back to the VM or to
another Mac.

**Agent Host runs** (Claude Code, Codex, ...) are not given a host sandbox:
they already run on the Mac. What they get instead is ``host_runs_native_
commands``, which withholds Lemma's duplicate command tools (§7).

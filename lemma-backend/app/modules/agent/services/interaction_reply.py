"""What a typed reply to a paused ``ask_user`` / ``request_approval`` means.

The agent owns the vocabulary of its own pauses: which words approve, which
deny, how a bare "2" picks the second option, what shape ``ask_user`` persisted
its questions in. A surface that gets a typed reply asks *this* whether it is an
answer and what answer it is, so the meaning of "go ahead" is one decision made
here rather than one each transport makes for itself.

What stays with the caller is plumbing: whether the message targets the pending
interaction at all, whether the person asked to type it, and falling through to
an ordinary message when this says the reply is not a decision.

Pure functions over the persisted tool args, no I/O.

# A typed approval reply is classified three ways, and the third case is the

# decision at all* and has to reach the agent as what the person actually wrote.
#
# There used to be no third case: everything outside the approve set became
# DENY. Since the caller treats a classified reply as consumed, "yeah go ahead"
# cancelled the action and "wait, why do you need that?" was a denial with the
# question thrown away — neither reply was ever delivered to anyone.
#
# Ambiguity is safe here *because* there is a third case. An unmatched reply
# falls through to the normal message path, where
# ``supersede_stale_pending_interactions`` auto-denies the pending call and the
# agent receives the person's words and can ask again. So these sets stay exact
# rather than growing prefix matches, which would let "yes, but only if X" read
# as consent.

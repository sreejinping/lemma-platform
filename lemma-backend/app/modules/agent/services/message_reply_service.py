"""Bring an asking conversation back when the people it messaged answer.

``message_user`` does not pause, and should not: a person takes hours, and an
execution suspended for hours is one that cannot be told anything in the
meantime. The agent sends, finishes its turn, and the conversation goes quiet.

What was missing was the other half — nothing brought it back. This is that
half, and it is deliberately *not* a wait. The asking run declares nothing and
holds nothing open; the replies are simply input, and input starts a turn. Same
rule as a person typing, and the same one this module's own
``infrastructure.adapters.workflow_control`` already uses to hand a
system-triggered run its prompt.

Which is why an agent no longer has any reason to ``wait_for`` after
``message_user``. Waiting is for work with a real gap in it — a build, a
thing that needs to settle — and it stopped being this feature's business.

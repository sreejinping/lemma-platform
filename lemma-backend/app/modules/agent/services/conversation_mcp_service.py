"""Request-scoped tool resolution for conversation MCP calls.

The caller is the Agent Host link: a local agent's Lemma tool calls arrive as
``mcp`` frames (``agent_host_link_mcp``), each re-authorized here against the
run's token and its conversation.

Thin adapter over `AgentToolDispatcher`: this service owns the conversation
authorization + context loading and the MCP wire format (``lemma_``-prefixed
names, `CallToolResult` wrapping); the dispatcher owns toolset resolution and
the actual tool invocation.

        `run.agent_runtime` is an `AgentRuntimeConfig` -- a profile id and a
        model name, and nothing else. It has no `model_capabilities`, so
        deriving the vision mode from it answered "this model cannot see" for
        every remote harness, whatever it was: a Claude Code or Codex host that
        reads images natively was told to delegate to a VISION_MODEL, and when
        none was configured, that PDF pages could not be viewed at all.

        Resolving is what produces capabilities, and `public_snapshot()` carries
        them precisely so the MCP bridges can rebuild a context. It costs one
        indexed lookup inside a unit of work this method already holds open, and
        no network call -- the model catalog lives on the profile.

        Falls back to the unresolved config on failure. A tool call must not
        fail because a profile was archived between the run starting and the
        model reaching for a file; the old behaviour was to delegate or refuse
        images, which is exactly what this returns to.

"""Assembling the context one run executes against.

Everything the tools will see: who is asking, which pod and workspace, what the
conversation already knows, and how this model answers image-returning tools.

It is built once, before the model is called, because several of these settle
each other — the vision mode has to be decided before the toolset is assembled,
since the assembler offers `view_image` based on it, and the workspace cwd has
to be written down before any tool can resolve a relative path against it.

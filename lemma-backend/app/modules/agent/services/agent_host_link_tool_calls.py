"""A relayed ``tools/call`` executes at most once.

The host's MCP bridge sends each ``tools/call`` with a ``request_id`` it mints
once and reuses on every retry of that call, including on a new link after a
reconnect. ``(run_id, request_id)`` is the call's identity here:

* the first arrival claims it in Redis (``SET NX``) and executes it;
* an arrival while it runs waits for the recorded outcome instead of running
  it again;
* an arrival after it finished is answered from the record.

The record outlives the link that carried the call: a link that drops mid-call
does not cancel it (the caller holds a strong reference to the execution, not
the session), so the retry on the next link finds the outcome waiting.

Redis, not memory: the retry can land on another API replica.

"""How the runtime brief reads: the rendering half, with no IO in it.

``agent_context_brief`` decides what to read; this decides what the agent sees.
Separated because the two change for different reasons -- a new inventory
section is a new query, while "say which columns are required" is a new line --
and because keeping both in one file put it over the size the architecture gate
allows.

Three of these exist because of what the brief used to leave out. A table line
that said only ``name:type`` hid whether a column was required, system-managed
or a foreign key, and hid ``enable_rls`` entirely -- so an agent told to land
durable state in a table could not tell whether the one it just made was the
team's ledger or one person's private notebook. And every run read identically,
whether a person was typing or a schedule had fired at six in the morning.

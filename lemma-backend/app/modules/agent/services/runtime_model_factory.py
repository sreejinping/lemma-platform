"""Build Pydantic AI models from resolved agent runtime profiles.

The HTTP client behind each provider is pooled per endpoint rather than rebuilt
per run. Building one per agent run meant a fresh connection pool every time —
no keep-alive reuse across a conversation's many model requests, a new TLS
handshake per turn, and a pool that was never closed. Half-open sockets left
behind by that churn are a plausible source of the mid-stream ``ReadError``s the
harness now has to recover from, so this is the other half of that fix.

    pydantic-ai's ``openai_continuous_usage_stats`` does two unrelated things:

    it switches the streaming handler from summing each chunk's usage to
    replacing with it. Only the second is wanted here, and the two have to be
    separated because they are not equally portable.

    The replace half is what keeps a provider that reports a running cumulative
    total on every chunk from being re-added on top of itself; without it a
    single turn bills a multiple of what it used. The request half is a vLLM
    extension rather than OpenAI's -- the openai SDK's own stream-options type
    does not carry the field -- so a strict OpenAI-compatible endpoint rejects
    the whole request for an unknown field. Models behind one provider disagree
    about accepting it, and this profile fronts whatever endpoint an operator
    points it at, so sending it makes streaming fail for some of them.

    Dropping it costs nothing: a provider that sends cumulative usage does so on
    its own, and the field cannot turn that off. So the setting stays on the
    profile for the accumulation it selects, and never reaches the wire.

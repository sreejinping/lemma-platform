"""Refusals for the HTTP routes Agent Host protocol 2 used to call.

Protocol 3 moved everything a paired machine says onto the link WebSocket, and
the HTTP routes went with it. But Desktop installs an update only when its
person agrees to one, so a machine paired to a hosted workspace can keep running
the host it shipped with for as long as nobody does, and that host never opens
the socket: it cannot be sent close code 4426. Left to 404s it would sit
"offline" forever with nothing telling anyone why.

So each old path answers with the one refusal the old host already understands,
and serves nothing else. What the old host does with each (read against
``desktop/agent-host/src`` as of protocol 2, on main before the link merged):

``POST /agent-host/poll``
    200 with a well-formed poll response naming protocol 3. ``TargetClient::poll``
    (``api.rs``) checks ``protocol_version != PROTOCOL_VERSION`` right after
    decoding and returns ``ApiError::Protocol(3)``. That is not a request
    rejection, so the worker (``runtime/worker.rs``) records the target OFFLINE
    with "target requested Agent Host protocol 3 is unsupported" as its last
    error and backs off to one attempt every 30 seconds. It keeps its pairing,
    so the updated app reconnects over the link with the same secret and no
    re-pair. The host's row is also marked UPGRADE_REQUIRED, which the
    workspace shows as "Needs updating".

    Every alternative is worse. A non-2xx is a request rejection, and the
    worker bisects its control batch around one -- up to 12 extra requests per
    cycle. A 200 saying ``UPGRADE_REQUIRED`` under protocol 2 first marks the
    target ONLINE and then ends the worker, which the supervisor restarts every
    scan. And ``401 AGENT_HOST_REVOKED_OR_MISSING`` makes the host drop its
    pairing after three refusals, so updating the app would not be enough:
    the person would have to pair the machine again.

Everything else
    410 Gone. Each is a request rejection to the old host, which stops rather
    than retries: an event batch is replayed once and then dropped (the run it
    belongs to is lost either way -- no protocol-2 host can hold a lease any
    more), a harness publish waits for the poll loop's next turn, and the MCP
    bridge fails the one tool call with a non-retryable error. Pairing and
    self-revocation surface the body's message to the person who asked.

Removable once no protocol-2 host can still be installed: see the removal note
in docs/architecture/agent-host.md#retired-http-routes.

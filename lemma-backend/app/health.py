"""Liveness, readiness and capability probes.

Four endpoints that were nested inside `create_app`, which was 382 lines of a
999-line `app.py`. They close over nothing but the router they register on, so
they move as a router rather than as a factory.

`include_in_schema=False` on every route, as before: these are for probes and
for a person with `curl`, not for the published API.

Probe contract:

- Liveness (`/health/live`, `/livez`, `/health`) answers one question: is this
  process's event loop wedged? It never checks a dependency. A database
  outage must not make every replica restart at once; restarting cannot fix
  it and turns a degraded service into an absent one.
- Readiness (`/health/ready`) is where dependencies live: database, Redis,
  SuperTokens, the worker, and the schema migration state. A failing
  dependency takes the replica out of rotation; it does not kill it.
  The migration check is not a per-probe query: `schema_migration_state()`
  never re-asks once the schema is current and rate-limits its re-checks
  while it is not.

    `api_version` is here because it is the only unauthenticated place a client

    other one, and production serves no OpenAPI document (`api_docs_served()`
    is off by default and deliberately not inferred from the environment) --

    skew against a local server, and silently reported "server_unreachable"

    it is already public, already cheap, and already the thing a client can
    reach before it has credentials.

    releases are mono-version, so this server's release is the newest `lemma`
    it knows of. It is a suggestion; no CLI version is ever refused.

"""What a person does with Lemma Desktop, done for real against a real install.

These paths differ from the server build -- the host pack's environment, the VZ
guest, locald's ports, WKWebView -- and every one of them has already shipped a
bug that the server-side suites could not see:

* every pod app rendered signed out, because WebKit will not send the session
  cookie across two `.localhost` hosts;
* every function died at ``getaddrinfo``, because sandboxes were handed an
  address only the Mac could resolve.

Both were found by a person using the app, not by CI. This is the suite that
would have caught them.

Run with ``make desktop-e2e``.

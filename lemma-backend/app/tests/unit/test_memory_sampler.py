"""Tests for the resident-memory floor tracker.

The whole value of this thing is one distinction: a process that peaks high and
gives it back is working, and a process whose *resting* level climbs is leaking.
Production shows both shapes on the same graph — a worker that spikes to 3.9 GiB
hourly and settles at 800 MiB is fine; an api pod that settles at 780, then 3,486
and stays is not. A tracker that cannot tell them apart would either alert on
every document conversion or miss the leak entirely.

"""The browser is a cache. When memory runs out, it is the thing that goes.

A workspace sandbox is 1 vCPU and 2048 MB, and a headed Chrome is the only
thing in it that can eat all of that. Measured on a real workspace after a
research session: 63 Chrome processes at 2123 MB resident, `MemAvailable` at
14 MB, kswapd0 burning a third of the only vCPU. In that state every unrelated
tool call in the same sandbox degraded with it -- `python -c pass` took 61
seconds, `lemma --version` never returned, and the agent saw `exit_code: 124`
with no explanation.

So the rule is about *what* to end, not how much. Only the browser is ever
touched. The agent's own processes are its work -- a build, a test run, a
server it started -- and killing those to free memory would destroy something
unreproducible to save something that is a cache by construction. The browser
can always be started again, and the next `web_fetch` does exactly that.

**This used to do the ending itself, and it was never once ending anything.**
It scanned `/proc`, matched command lines against a list of patterns, and
sent SIGTERM then SIGKILL. The patterns were written when agent-browser
installed its own Chromium under `~/.agent-browser/browsers/` and the image
launched it through a `workspace-chrome` wrapper. The image uses Debian's
chromium now and a running process reports `/usr/lib/chromium/chromium`,
which carries none of those strings: counted on a real sandbox, 14 Chromium
processes and 13 matched by nothing in the list. So for as long as that has
been true this guard has been shedding the display and the daemon while
leaving every process that held the memory -- and nobody noticed, which is
the most useful thing anybody has learnt about what the machinery was worth.

What replaces it is one call. `agent-browser close --all` is the CLI that
owns the browser's lifecycle, and it is also the only stop that keeps a
login: on a real sandbox, one second after signing in, it keeps the session,
while SIGTERM to all eleven processes loses it and so does SIGTERM to the
browser process alone, even exiting cleanly in half a second.

The reason is not Chrome's own commit timer, which is what this said first.
`agent-browser` does not run Chrome on the profile it is configured with --
it launches on a throwaway `--user-data-dir=/tmp/agent-browser-chrome-<uuid>`
and copies the profile back **when it is closed cleanly, and only then**.
Measured directly: the durable `Cookies` file's mtime does not move while the
browser runs, moves on `close --all`, and the cookie is there after a reopen.

The difference matters. Under a commit timer, waiting long enough would make
a kill safe; under copy-on-close nothing ever does, so there is no version of
this that escalates to a signal after a timeout. That is also why `release`
and `quiesce` both close before they pause rather than after.

So the simpler version is also the correct one, and it names no process, so
it cannot go quietly out of date the way the pattern list did.

It can fail -- a sandbox with nothing left may not manage to spawn a Node
CLI -- and nothing here escalates to a signal afterwards. The honest reason
is that the escalation is what was there before and it did not work. A
sandbox that far gone is released and replaced, and the daemon retires the
browser by itself five minutes after anything stops driving it.

"""The backstop that holds when everything gentler has already failed.

Nothing here signals a real process, because nothing in the subject does any
more. This guard used to scan `/proc`, match command lines against a list of
patterns and send SIGTERM then SIGKILL -- and the patterns had gone stale, so
on a real sandbox it matched 1 of 14 Chromium processes and had been shedding
the display and the daemon while leaving everything that held the memory.

It asks the daemon to close the browser now: measured to be the only stop
that also writes the profile back, and it names no process, so it cannot go
quietly out of date the way the pattern list did.

**And it reads the cgroup, because `/proc/meminfo` is not namespaced.**
Measured inside a container limited to 2 GiB: `MemTotal` 8.8 GiB, `nproc` 8,
`memory.max` 2147483648. The threshold it used to apply was comparing a
host-wide number against a per-sandbox one -- unfireable on a roomy host,
and liable to fire for somebody else's reasons on a busy one.

Two negatives here are worth as much as the positives, and both come from
measurement rather than reasoning: a cgroup whose `memory.current` has
reached `memory.max` purely on page cache must not shed, and the
twelve-heavy-tab state that the research recorded as healthy must not shed
either.

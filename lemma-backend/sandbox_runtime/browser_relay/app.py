"""The browser relay: one door into this sandbox's browser, for the backend.

Why this is a separate process rather than a route on the workspace runtime:
**E2B sandboxes do not run the workspace runtime.** They serve no HTTP inside
the sandbox at all -- exec and files go through the provider's own SDK -- so a
browser channel that lived in the runtime worked on Docker and existed nowhere
else, which is precisely what happened the first time this was built. A small
process baked into the image runs wherever the image runs: Docker, E2B, the
desktop guest, and anything later that can start a container.

Why not publish the browser's own ports and let a viewer reach them directly: on
E2B every port is a public name, so a forwarded CDP port would put raw Chrome
debugging protocol -- which reads every cookie and evaluates arbitrary script --
behind nothing but a traffic token, and `agent-browser`'s stream server has no
authentication of its own at all. Everything it serves is reached *through* this
process instead, which is the thing holding the delivered token.

The token is read from a file the backend places through the provider's own
secret-delivery path, and re-read on every request so a resumed sandbox can be
handed a fresh one without restarting anything.

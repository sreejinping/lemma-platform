"""Finding, starting, and steering the Chrome this sandbox runs.

A live, drivable view of it is not this module's job any more. Two earlier
designs lived here in turn: driving CDP's `Page.startScreencast` and
`Input.dispatch*` directly, then proxying `agent-browser`'s own session-scoped
stream server (`stream_port`, and the JPEG frame protocol -- both gone;
`stream_proxy.py` survives under its old name, now carrying RFB bytes for
`app.py`'s `/vnc` route rather than frames). What replaced
both is `x11vnc` and `websockify` in front of the Xvfb display Chrome already
runs on: a real screen rather than a translated one, so there is no frame
protocol, no viewport measurement and no coordinate space for this module to
answer questions about any more. `app.py`'s `/vnc` route talks to that
directly; what is left here is Chrome's own lifecycle: where it is, whether
it is up, and how to point it at a page. Three things make that awkward, and
all three are handled here rather than by whoever calls it.

**The port is not fixed.** Chrome writes it to ``DevToolsActivePort`` in the
profile directory on every launch. Forcing a fixed ``--remote-debugging-port``
instead does not work: ``agent-browser`` waits for that file and a forced port
stops it appearing, which breaks every other browser tool in the process.

**That file outlives the browser.** Chrome does not remove it on the way out,
and the browser leaves often -- ``agent-browser`` retires it after five idle
minutes, and the memory guard SIGKILLs it under pressure. So the file is a
record of where Chrome *was*, and reading it alone reports a port that nothing
is listening on. It cost a long debugging session: a viewer that asked to watch
a browser which had timed out got a connection error rather than "not running",
which surfaced as a 500 and, to the person clicking, as an unexplained failure.
Hence: the recorded port is a candidate, and it is not believed until something
answers on it.

**Nothing here is reachable from outside.** Chrome binds loopback, and so do
`x11vnc` and `websockify` -- all reached *through* this process, which is also
the right answer for safety: it puts a place to stand between a viewer and the
browser, and it means no new port is published.

    Called by `/vnc` before it accepts, because the relay is what serves the

    backend's ensure string asks for this too, but not every caller comes
    through the backend -- the workspace e2e drives this route directly, and
    found exactly the gap this closes.

    Missing script means an older image, where both processes are already
    running because the display brought them up. Nothing to start, and not
    an error.

    **Stderr goes to a file and this waits on the process, rather than
    `communicate()`.** Measured, and the difference is not small: the same
    script takes 0.22s from a standalone `asyncio.run` and hits an
    eight-second timeout from inside the relay, every time, while its work
    has actually finished in the first fraction of a second. `communicate()`
    returns when the process exits *and* the pipe reaches EOF, and the write
    end of that pipe is inherited by the `setsid` grandchildren this script
    exists to leave running -- x11vnc and websockify outlive it deliberately,
    so the pipe never closes and the wait always runs to the timeout.

    In CI that timeout was the whole failure: the route sat here for longer
    than a `websockets.connect` will wait for a handshake, and the viewer saw
    a dropped TCP connection with no close frame and no reason. A file has no
    EOF to wait for, and it cannot fill and deadlock either.

# Lemma Backend

FastAPI backend platform for building AI-powered connectors around isolated pods. Each pod packages structured data, files, deterministic functions, agents, workflows, assistants, and user-facing apps for one use case.

The backend lives in `lemma-backend/` inside the `lemma-platform` monorepo. It is a normal Python project with its own `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, migrations, scripts, and Docker Compose files.

> Engineering conventions (DB sessions/connections, caching, the authorization
> model, secrets) live in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md). The
> runtime module catalog is in [docs/modules/README.md](docs/modules/README.md).
> This README covers setup and running the stack.

## Monorepo dependencies

The repository does not use submodules. Backend code depends on sibling packages in the monorepo:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `../lemma-harness/` | Next.js frontend used by the local app runner |
| `../lemma-python/` | `lemma-sdk`, the Python SDK (the `lemma` CLI is `lemma-terminal`, in `../lemma-cli/`) |
| `../lemma-pod-bundle/` | The pod bundle format, shared with the CLI |
| `../lemma-typescript/` | TypeScript SDK used by apps |
| `../lemma-skills/` | Built-in agent skills loaded by the backend and workspace containers |
| `sandbox_runtime/` | The runtime inside sandbox images, and its protocol |
| `sandbox-images/` | Dockerfiles and templates for the sandbox images |

## Development

### Setup

```bash
make init                       # (repo root) generate .env files with local dev defaults + keys
cd lemma-backend && uv sync     # install deps into .venv (uses uv.lock)
```

`make init` writes the backend `.env` (DB/Redis/SuperTokens URLs, encryption keys, sandbox settings). Re-run it any time to backfill missing keys.

### Run the full stack (recommended)

From the **repo root** — infra in Docker + backend + frontend + the sandbox runtime as hot-reload host processes:

```bash
make dev                # start everything
make dev RELOAD=1       # same, with uvicorn --reload on the backend
make stop               # stop backend/frontend host processes
make stop-all           # also bring down the infra containers
make logs               # tail backend logs
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3710`
- API: `http://localhost:8710`
- API docs (Scalar): `http://localhost:8710/scalar`

`make dev` runs Postgres/Redis/SuperTokens in Docker and the backend as **one** host process (`uvicorn local_app:app`) that combines the FastAPI app, the streaq event worker, and the scheduler — convenient for local dev. It also installs the local `lemma` CLI and registers it as the `local-dev` server:

```bash
lemma servers select local-dev
lemma auth login
```

### Run API and worker separately (prod topology)

Production runs the API and the worker as **two** processes. There is no third scheduler process — time triggers are streaq crons on the worker's lanes. To mirror the split locally, start infra, then run each process yourself from `lemma-backend/`:

```bash
docker compose up -d                  # infra: postgres, redis, supertokens
uv run alembic upgrade head           # apply migrations

# API only
uv run uvicorn app.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# streaq worker — agent runs, file (re)indexing, surface ingest, datastore
# cleanup, and every cron/time/webhook schedule
uv run python -m app.worker
```

Two Dockerized versions of this split exist: `deploy/compose/` is the real self-hosted deployment (see [self-hosting](../docs/self-hosting.md)), and the load-test compose is a resource-capped copy for measurement — see [Load testing](#load-testing).

## Testing

Two levels — **unit** and **e2e** — and e2e runs in two modes: a fast **mocked** mode (the default, what CI uses) and a **real** mode (manual/nightly).

### Unit

No containers, no network.

```bash
make test-unit                  # everything not marked `e2e`
make test-module MODULE=pod     # a single module (app/modules/pod)
make test                       # unit + e2e
```

### e2e — mocked (default gate)

Container-backed but with **no external services**: the agent LLM is an in-process pydantic-ai `FunctionModel` (scriptable per conversation), and workspace tools + functions hit an in-process **fake sandbox** — so **no model API key and no Docker workspace image** are needed. Postgres/Redis/SuperTokens are provided per worker by testcontainers; the
`indexing`-marked tests additionally share one document-extractor container.

```bash
make test-e2e         # all mocked e2e (parallel via pytest-xdist)
make test-e2e-fast    # fast API subset (excludes slow/worker/workspace/provider/local_cli)
```

Parallelism is controlled by `E2E_WORKERS` (default **2**). Each xdist worker spins up its **own** isolated container trio + loads an embedding model, so workers are RAM-hungry:

```bash
make test-e2e-fast E2E_WORKERS=auto   # one worker per core (roomy machines)
make test-e2e-fast E2E_WORKERS=1      # serial — most reliable (no inter-worker contention)
```

> The fast suite shares a single Kreuzberg container across workers, so under
> `-n2`+ it can be **contention-flaky** (a different test fails each run, all pass
> standalone/serially). Use `E2E_WORKERS=1` for a deterministic green.

### e2e — real (manual / nightly)

Uses the **real model** (`LEMMA_OPENAI_API_KEY`) + the **real Docker sandbox**, and runs the `real_llm` / `real_sandbox` tests. Serial.

```bash
make test-e2e-real      # all e2e against the real model + Docker sandbox
make test-e2e-runtime   # exactly what backend-protected-e2e.yml runs
```

`test-e2e-runtime` is byte-identical to the protected workflow, asserted by
`test_the_protected_lane_can_be_reproduced_from_the_makefile`. It selects the
slow/workspace/indexing subset and deliberately not `local_cli` (needs a
cargo-built Agent Host; `make desktop-agent-host-e2e` supplies it) or
`benchmark` (wall-clock budgets; `make benchmark-functions-docker` owns them).

### Markers & modes

Markers: `e2e`, `slow`, `worker` (needs the real streaq worker), `workspace` (needs a real sandbox provider), `provider` (needs the real model), `local_cli`. The model can be deterministic or real via `E2E_LLM_MODE=mock|real`; sandbox coverage always uses Docker (`E2E_SANDBOX_MODE=docker`) or credential-gated E2B.

### Pre-merge e2e gate (CI)

e2e is **not** run on every commit (it's expensive). It runs as a separate, opt-in gate (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`): add the **`run-e2e`** label to a PR, or trigger *Actions → "Backend E2E" → Run workflow*. It is a real end-to-end run (Postgres/Redis/SuperTokens/workers/fake providers); only the LLM and the sandbox are stubbed. Per-commit CI (`ci.yml`) runs unit + build/lint/SDK checks only.

## Coverage

```bash
make coverage                       # unit + e2e -> coverage-unit.xml + coverage-e2e.xml
make coverage-unit                  # unit only (term-missing + xml)
make coverage-e2e                   # e2e only
make coverage-module MODULE=agent   # per-module, fails under 90%
```

## Lint

```bash
make lint     # ruff check .
```

## Load testing

A prod-shaped stack (1-CPU/2-GB API + worker as separate containers) plus k6 journeys that exercise the full surface — chat, file CRUD, function execute, app load — at 100 concurrent users using the mock LLM + fake sandbox.

```bash
make load-test-build && make load-test-up && make load-test-migrate
make load-test-journey MAX_USERS=100 THINK_MS=500   # full chat+file+function+app journey
make load-test-monitor                              # poll pg_stat_activity during a run
make load-test-down
```

Each run writes its own report under `load_tests/`.

## Migrations

```bash
make migrate                                            # alembic upgrade head
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe_what_changed"
```

New ORM models must be imported in `migrations/env.py` before autogenerate can detect them.

## Connector app catalog

The connector catalog (apps, operations, and triggers) is managed via
[`scripts/import_connector_catalog.py`](scripts/import_connector_catalog.py).

- **Native (Lemma) apps** are always imported — every entry in
  `scripts/lemma_apps_config.json`. Those with curated `static_operations`
  (GitHub, Slack, Gmail) run as `http`-kind connectors against the provider's
  own OpenAPI description; the operation sets are regenerated offline by
  `scripts/generate_*_static_operations.py` from the specs in `openapi_specs/`.
- **Composio apps** are imported only when `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` is set (skipped
  gracefully otherwise).

```bash
uv run python scripts/import_connector_catalog.py                  # native + Composio (if key set)
uv run python scripts/import_connector_catalog.py --provider native
uv run python scripts/import_connector_catalog.py --app gmail --app slack
uv run python scripts/import_connector_catalog.py --dry-run        # fetch + log, no commit
uv run python scripts/import_connector_catalog.py --generate-skills  # needs FIREWORKS_API_KEY
```

The curated Composio allowlist is in the script (`DEFAULT_COMPOSIO_CONNECTOR_IDS`); add more with `COMPOSIO_EXTRA_APP_IDS=linear,notion`.

## Secret encryption & key rotation

Secrets at rest (connector credentials, OAuth provider configs, agent runtime
credentials, surface webhook secrets) and short-lived signed tokens (widget
embeds, datastore file URLs) all go through [`app/core/crypto`](app/core/crypto/),
which supports versioned envelopes and **key rotation without data loss**.

**Env (env-only, no KMS in prod for now):**

| Var | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Primary Fernet key. **Falls back to `CONNECTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** when unset, then to a local dev seed in local/testing. Generate: `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"` |
| `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEYSET` | Optional JSON `[{"kid","key","primary"}]` for rotation (primary encrypts new writes; retired keys still decrypt) |
| `SECRET_KEY_PROVIDER` | `auto` (default) → `static` env keys. (`gcp_kms` / `gcp_secret_manager` / `keychain` also available.) |

**Rotation** is keyset-driven via `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEYSET` (a JSON list with one
`primary` that encrypts new writes; retired keys still decrypt) — add a new
primary, let writes re-envelope over time, then drop the old key once nothing
references it. The old `CONNECTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is also still read, so releasing
onto an existing DB needs no key change: old `fernet-json-v1` values decrypt and
new writes use the v2 envelope. Apply migrations first (`make migrate`) — they
widen `agent_surfaces.webhook_secret` to Text for the v2 envelope.

## Docker images

```bash
make docker-build         # backend image (from the monorepo root context)
make sandbox-images       # local workspace + function sandbox images
```

Release images are published to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/lemma-work/*`)
by `.github/workflows/release-local-images.yml`.

"""One-time offline generator for the Gmail connector's ``static_operations``.

Not part of the runtime import path (``import_connector_catalog.py`` never
imports this module). Run by hand whenever the curated operation set changes,
and the output is spliced into ``lemma_apps_config.json``'s ``"gmail"`` entry.

The spec is Google's own Gmail v1 discovery document converted to OpenAPI,
committed at ``lemma-backend/openapi_specs/gmail.json``.

Two things about it need saying, both handled by the shared OpenAPI machinery:

* Every operationId is prefixed ``gmail.users.``, so the derived tool names
  would all read ``gmail_users_messages_send``. ``_public_name`` strips that
  prefix, which is also exactly the name the connector package this replaces
  produced -- so no operation is renamed by the migration.
* ``userId`` is a required path parameter on all 79 operations and the only
  value anyone passes is ``me``. It is declared as a ``path_param_defaults``
  entry so an agent need not supply it and a profile fetch with an empty payload
  still resolves. It stays in the input schema, so another mailbox can still be
  addressed where the token allows it.

Usage::

    uv run python scripts/generate_gmail_static_operations.py
    uv run python scripts/generate_gmail_static_operations.py --write

# Curated from the 79 operations the spec describes.
#
# What is deliberately absent, and why:
#
#   * All 11 `settings.cse.*` operations -- client-side-encryption keypairs.
#     `obliterate` destroys a key irrecoverably.
#   * All 4 `settings.delegates.*` -- Workspace-admin mailbox delegation.
#   * Every forwarding and filter *write*: `forwardingAddresses.create`,
#     `updateAutoForwarding`, `filters.create`, `filters.delete`. A mail
#     forwarding rule is a standing instruction that outlives the conversation
#     that created it and quietly copies future mail elsewhere. The reads stay,
#     so an agent can still notice one exists and say so.
#   * `sendAs.create/delete/patch/update/verify` and the 5 `smimeInfo` routes --
#     these change which addresses the mailbox can send *as*.
#   * `messages.import` and `messages.insert`, which write mail into the mailbox
#     without sending it -- a forged-message primitive with no agent use.
#   * `messages.delete`, `messages.batchDelete` and `threads.delete`, which are
#     permanent and bypass the trash. `trash`/`untrash` cover the same intent
#     reversibly and are kept.
#   * `stop` and `watch` (Cloud Pub/Sub push, needs a GCP topic), and the
#     `imap`/`pop`/`language` account toggles.

# big framebuffer but cannot grow one, so a viewer asking for a display that
# matches their pane (`/display:resize`) is bounded by this. 1920x1200x24 is
# ~9 MB.
#
# The ceiling and the size actually shown are two different things, and both
# matter. Allocating 1920x1200 is what lets a wide pane be matched later;
# *running* at it costs every frame x11vnc encodes and every frame `record`
# grabs ~1.67x what 1440x960 does, for a picture nobody asked to be that big.
# Left at the ceiling, that was enough to kill a screen recording mid-take on
# a 2 GB sandbox on a loaded CI runner -- the recording started, died, and
# `record stop` reported "No recording in progress".
#
# So: allocate the ceiling, then size the mode down to the default before any
# X client is started. The earlier attempt at this *was* a race -- the same
# command landed sometimes and not others -- because x11vnc was already up and
# grabbing its first frame while the mode changed underneath it. Done here it
# cannot be: x11vnc and the window manager are started further down, and the
# branch that restarts Xvfb kills both first.

# This removed `SingletonCookie`, `SingletonLock`, `SingletonSocket` and
# `DevToolsActivePort` before every launch, on the theory that a file naming
# a dead process would stop the next Chrome starting. Measured on a real
# sandbox instead: `kill -9` the browser, leave all four behind, and
# `agent-browser open` starts one and rewrites them, because Chrome checks
# whether the pid a lock names is still alive.
#
# It was never free, either. `DevToolsActivePort` is the only record of a
# running browser's port, and this script is idempotent by `pgrep` -- a
# second run leaves the existing Chrome alone -- so deleting it here left a
# browser that nothing could find, for as long as the sandbox lived.
# `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` is the one that matters for
# the journey this feature exists for. Chrome otherwise sets
# `navigator.webdriver` and turns on the AutomationControlled blink feature,
# and the login pages an agent meets are exactly the pages that look. Being
# refused at a sign-in wall for wearing an automation badge is a failure with
# no upside: the person is sitting there, signing in to their own account.
#
# The rest of the list is what makes Chromium run at all in a container without
# a session bus or a large /dev/shm. `AGENT_BROWSER_ARGS` can extend this per
# sandbox without editing the image.
# Regenerated every run rather than only when missing. A resumed sandbox
# keeps whatever `config.json` its last run wrote, and a proxy assigned since
# then -- a new resume can land on a different sandbox instance -- must reach
# Chrome's next launch, not wait for a profile that happens not to exist yet.
# `--test-type` is here for one reason: it suppresses the yellow "You are
# using an unsupported command-line flag: --no-sandbox" infobar. That bar is
# not a warning anybody in this product can act on -- the sandbox flag is
# required to run Chrome inside a container, and the container *is* the
# isolation boundary -- but it sits across the top of every frame the person
# watching sees, steals a strip of the page, and reads like the browser is
# broken. It changes no behaviour beyond hiding infobars and a first-run
# bubble; it does not make this a "test build" of Chrome, which is a
# different thing -- the binary is whatever `workspace-chrome` points at,
# Debian Chromium on the Docker image and `google-chrome-stable` on E2B.

# Chrome's own size is *not* set here, and cannot be: this list is
# comma-separated (agent-browser splits it), and every flag that would say a
# size takes a comma inside its value. `--window-size=1920,1200` arrives at
# Chrome as `--window-size=1920` followed by a stray `1200`, which Chrome
# ignores -- so the window stayed at its default 945px while the flag looked
# present in the config. What fills the display is the window manager started
# further down, which maximises whatever Chrome opens; that is measured, and it
# keeps working when a viewer resizes the display underneath it.
# Whether this browser goes through a proxy is the API server's decision,
# re-asserted at every browser start.
#
# It used to be baked into the sandbox's creation environment, which meant
# it could be given and never withdrawn: clearing the pool server-side left
# every existing sandbox proxied until it was replaced, and workspace
# sandboxes are not replaced on drift. The server writes its decision to a
# file instead -- one line, the URL or empty -- and this reads it on every
# run. Empty is a decision, not an absence: it is how "stop using a proxy"
# reaches a sandbox that already has one.
#
# `AGENT_BROWSER_PROXY` is then unset, and that is load-bearing rather than

#
#     env + config -> --proxy-server=http://ENVWINS.invalid:8080
#     config only  -> --proxy-server=http://CONFIGONLY.invalid:9091

# 66 MiB, or the whole viewing chain, for a picture no socket is attached to.
#
# `start-vnc-bridge` brings both up, and the viewer path runs it: the relay
# client's ensure string, and `/vnc` itself before it accepts a socket. The
# agent's own paths -- `lemma-node-tool`, `save-webpage` -- do not.

# Down to the size we actually mean to run at.
#
# Here, and not earlier, because `set-display-size` documents why: against an
# Xvfb that x11vnc has not attached to, `xrandr --newmode` exits 0 and creates
# nothing, so a size-down before this point silently does not happen -- which
# is exactly what it did when it was placed above, and why an earlier attempt
# at this was abandoned as "racy".
#
# Worth doing rather than living at the ceiling: the framebuffer is allocated
# at `SCREEN` so a wide pane can still be matched later, but *running* at
# 1920x1200 makes every frame x11vnc encodes and every frame `agent-browser
# record` grabs ~1.67x the work of 1440x960. On a 2 GB sandbox that was enough
# to lose a screen recording part-way through, with `record stop` reporting
# "No recording in progress" and nothing saying why.
#
# Non-fatal: a display left at the ceiling is a bigger picture than intended,
# which is worth a line in the log and not a failed browser.
#
# The precondition is an X client, and matchbox is one.

# This used to wait for x11vnc's port before resizing, on the recorded
# grounds that "against an Xvfb that x11vnc has not attached to,
# `xrandr --newmode` exits 0 and creates nothing". The first half of that is
# true and the attribution was wrong. Measured three times each, on this
# image:
#
#     nothing attached   -> stays 1920x1200 (and says so on stderr)
#     matchbox only      -> 1440x960
#     matchbox + x11vnc  -> 1440x960
#
# So any X client satisfies it, matchbox is already running by this point,
# and the size-down no longer needs the viewing half of the stack to exist.

# A daemon whose CDP session has gone stale cannot be talked out of it, and
# on a sandbox with a proxy it fails in the worst available way: installing
# the network controls is also what answers Chrome's `Fetch.authRequired`,
# so when that call fails with
#
#     Failed to install browser network controls:
#       CDP error (Fetch.enable): Session with given id not found.
#
# every request through a perfectly healthy credentialed proxy comes back
# 407 and no page ever loads. Seen in production: the browser worked, a
# person was handed the wheel, and every open after that failed this way --
# an agent then spent twenty commands trying to reason its way out, because
# nothing in the message says the daemon is the thing that is wrong.
#
# So it is retried exactly once, against a daemon that has been stopped
# first. `close --all` is the stop, because it is the only one that commits
# Chrome's cookie store, and `--all` because the stale session may belong to
# a named sign-in session rather than this one. One retry, not a loop: if a
# fresh daemon fails the same way the fault is not staleness and a second
# attempt only delays the error reaching somebody.
# The command *is* the function's exit status. Written as an `if` with a
# `return $?` in the else branch, it always returned 0 -- the `if` statement
# had completed by then and `$?` was its own success.

Usage: save-webpage <url> [options]

Save a rendered web page from the shared Agent Browser session.

Options:
  --formats <list>   Comma-separated: markdown,md,pdf,jpeg,jpg,png (default: markdown,pdf,jpeg)
  --full-page        Capture the whole scroll, not just the viewport. Slow and
                     large -- one news page measured 12.4s and 7.0 MB.
  --screenshot-quality <0-100>  JPEG quality (default 70).
  --out <dir>        Output directory (default: current working directory)
  --name <name>      Base output filename without extension
  --wait-ms <ms>     Fallback wait after navigation (default: 1000)
  --no-open          Reuse the current page instead of navigating first
  -h, --help         Show this help

Examples:
  save-webpage https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
  save-webpage https://example.com --formats markdown,pdf,jpeg --out ~/research

# `tab new` binds the session to the tab it opens, and every command after it
# -- `wait`, `eval`, `get url`, `get html`, `screenshot`, `pdf` -- acts on
# whatever the session is bound to *now*. One browser serves every
# conversation in a sandbox, so two captures running at once rebind the same
# session: the second `tab new` steals the binding and the first capture then
# reads, screenshots and saves the second one's page, under the first one's
# name. Nothing fails; the file is just of the wrong page.
#
# A lock rather than per-command tab addressing, because tab addressing is
# still a select followed by a command and the race lives in the gap. And it
# costs nothing: the sandbox has one vCPU, and three captures run in parallel
# measured 75.4s against 11.0s for the same three run one after another. The
# serialisation was already the faster arrangement.
#
# The wait sits just under `_BROWSER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (75s), which is what
# `web_fetch` gives one capture. Longer would be moot -- the caller kills us
# first, and the agent gets a bare timeout instead of a sentence saying the
# browser was busy. A typical capture is 4-12s, so this covers a queue of

# A capture gets its own tab, and gives it back.
#
# Every captured page used to land in the one shared tab and stay there. The
# session is deliberately long-lived -- one browser, one Xvfb display, one
# profile per sandbox -- so nothing ever reclaimed what a capture rendered, and
# Chrome keeps a process per site-instance. A workspace measured after a normal
# research session held 63 Chrome processes (2123 MB summed across them, which
# over-counts: see below) RSS on a sandbox with
# 2048 MB total: `MemAvailable` was 14 MB, kswapd0 burned a third of the only
# vCPU, and every unrelated tool call in that sandbox degraded with it --
# `python -c pass` took over 12 seconds and `lemma --version` never returned at
# all. The agent saw `exit_code: 124` and no explanation.
#
# A correction to the arithmetic above, since it has been quoted as a reason
# not to open a second tab: summing per-process RSS counts Chrome's shared
# mappings once per process. Measured against the cgroup, which is what
# actually OOMs, five concurrent tabs in one browser peaked at 1656 MiB of
# 2048 and fell back to baseline when they closed. Tabs are cheap. What is
# not cheap is a second *browser*: three captures with a session each
# measured 75.4s against 11.0s for the same three run serially through one
# warm browser, because the sandbox has one vCPU.
#
# So the tab is closed on the way out, via trap: `set -e` means any capture
# step can abort the script, and the failing captures are exactly the expensive
# pages worth reclaiming. `--no-open` reuses whatever page the caller already
# has open -- that tab belongs to them, so this must not touch it.
# Is a browser already serving this profile? Shared with
# `lemma-ensure-display`, which asks the same question for a different
# reason, and the two must not drift.

  # networkidle is the wrong question twice over. An ad-funded page never
  # reaches it -- something is always polling -- and a React page reaches
  # `domcontentloaded` with an empty shell, so neither signal says "there is
  # something here to read". This used to wrap networkidle in `timeout 5`,
  # which made it worse rather than bounded: killing the CLI leaves the wait
  # pending in the daemon and the next CDP call queues behind it. Measured on
  # reuters, the call after the cap blocked 20.3s whatever it was --
  # `window.stop()` blocked exactly as long as `get url`. The cap moved the
  # wait; it never shortened it.

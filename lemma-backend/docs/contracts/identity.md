# identity contract

What every `identity` API operation guarantees: who may call it, what must be true first, what changes, what it emits, and how it refuses.

The product promises these serve are in [the product specification](../../../docs/product/README.md). This says what each operation does; that says what any of it is for.

The table below is generated from the committed OpenAPI specification by `scripts/check_contracts.py --write`. Add the behaviour in prose under each operation's heading, outside the generated block — that part is preserved across regeneration.

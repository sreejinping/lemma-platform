# Agent module

## Purpose

`app/modules/agent` owns agent definitions, conversations/messages, model runs,
runtime profiles, Agent Host dispatch, tool assembly, approvals, realtime
streaming, MCP access, widgets, and usage handoff. It is the central execution
module; external delivery belongs to [agent surfaces](agent_surfaces.md), and
sandbox lifecycle belongs to [workspace](workspace.md).

## Runtime contributions

| Contribution | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| API routers | Agent CRUD/permissions, conversations/messages/SSE, runtime profiles, Agent Host pairing/dispatch, tools, widgets |
| Redis consumer | Converts agent lifecycle events into queued work and title generation |
| streaq tasks | Run agents, generate titles, reconcile orphaned runs |
| Published stream | `agent_events` |
| Mounted MCP apps | Conversation and pod tool servers are assembled by the backend root using agent services |

Durable lifecycle events are staged in the PostgreSQL outbox and reach Redis
Streams only through the core message bus. Transient token/status frames use the
core realtime-channel port with a Redis Pub/Sub adapter; each SSE connection
leases one subscription connection and releases it on completion, failure, or
cancellation.

## Main data model

| Table | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `agents` | Named prompt, schemas, toolsets, runtime selection, visibility |
| `agent_runtime_profiles` | Organization/user/system model provider configuration and encrypted credentials |
| `agent_host_pairings` | Single-use pairing codes a user authorizes; consuming one deletes the row, so presence is the whole validity check and a replayed code looks like one that never existed |
| `agent_hosts`, `agent_host_harnesses` | Paired Agent Host installations and their harness snapshots |
| `agent_host_commands`, `agent_host_run_leases` | Durable command handout and the single dispatch fence per run |
| `agent_conversations` | Pod thread, the agent it belongs to (the pod's assistant is a row like any other), parent/subagent and workspace metadata |
| `agent_messages` | User/assistant/tool messages and structured parts |
| `agent_runs` | One execution attempt, status, usage, errors, stop state, harness metadata |
| `agent_conversation_waits` | What a paused turn is waiting on — wait type, external reference, wake deadline, and the fire lease a timer tick takes; a partial unique index allows one `ACTIVE` row per conversation, mirroring `workflow_run_waits` |
| `agent_approval_decisions`, `agent_feedback` | Durable interaction/audit records |

## API groups

| Routes | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `/pods/{pod_id}/agents` | Agent CRUD plus resource permission replacement |
| `/pods/{pod_id}/conversations` | Create/list/read/update, messages, approvals, send, stream, stop |
| `/organizations/{org}/agent-runtime/profiles` | Discover/create model runtime profiles |
| `/me/runtime/agent-hosts...`, `/agent-host/link` | Agent Host pairing and management; the host's link WebSocket (commands, events, harnesses, Lemma MCP) |
| `/tools/*` | Server-side web search and feedback endpoints used by runtimes |
| `/widgets/serve...`, `/pods/{pod}/widgets...` | Render/submit a tool widget and mint an authenticated embed URL |

## Run lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> QUEUED: user message committed
    QUEUED --> RUNNING: process_agent_run claims run
    RUNNING --> WAITING_FOR_INPUT: ask-user or approval tool
    WAITING_FOR_INPUT --> QUEUED: answer/decision resumes conversation
    RUNNING --> COMPLETED: final output persisted
    RUNNING --> FAILED: model/tool/runtime error
    QUEUED --> STOPPED: stop before execution
    RUNNING --> STOPPED: cooperative stop
```

The runner resolves a runtime profile and harness (`pydantic_ai`, Agent Host,
or test harness), builds only the allowed toolsets, creates short UoWs for
message/status transitions, performs model/tool I/O outside them, publishes
realtime frames, and records usage. Tool calls receive a delegated workload
context; destructive operations require a standing grant or session approval.
Agent Host runs are fenced by a per-run lease row, so a host that reconnects
cannot double-dispatch a run already in flight.

Subagents are child conversations with inherited workspace context and reduced
toolsets. Widgets are tool outputs stored in conversation context and served
through signed, purpose-bound embed access.

## Prompt context

Prompts combine a compact pod resource map, the agent's role, reply guidance,
and fragments for its enabled toolsets. Resource authoring details live in
skills. Agent and conversation instructions follow
the static guidance; runtime context and the task list follow those to preserve
the cached prefix. In-process capabilities and Agent Host use the same fragments.

Table summaries include primary keys, column types and write constraints,
foreign keys, RLS, and visibility. Column descriptions are available through
table inspection rather than repeated in every prompt. Omission counts mark
truncated inventories and schemas.

## Key dependencies

- Pod/identity: tenant, membership, authorization, delegation.
- Datastore/connectors/function: agent-callable resources.
- Workspace: shell, Python, browser, file, and long-lived process sessions.
- Usage: reserve and record model cost.
- Agent surfaces: surface context and platform tools; this dependency is
  currently bidirectional.

## Tests and operations

The test suite covers tool assembly, messages, approvals, cancellation,
runtime profiles, Agent Host dispatch, MCP, widgets, usage, subagents, and
mocked/real harness paths. This module carries the largest orchestration classes
in the backend; their size and cross-module coupling are held flat by the
`make architecture` ratchet rather than reduced.

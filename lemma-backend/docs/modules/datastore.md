# Datastore module

## Purpose

`app/modules/datastore` gives each pod structured tables/records and a searchable
file tree. It manages dynamic PostgreSQL schemas, row-level authorization,
object storage, document-to-Markdown conversion, embeddings/search, signed
downloads, and live record-change streams.

Operator configuration for local, GCS, S3, and Azure storage is documented in
[Object storage](../operators/object-storage.md).

## Runtime contributions

| Contribution | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| API routers | Table, record, SQL query, file, signed/public file, and WebSocket change APIs |
| Redis consumer | Queues file indexing from `datastore_events` |
| streaq tasks | Process files, clean deleted storage paths, recover stale processing rows; nightly, drop the schemas of pods deleted more than `DATASTORE_ORPHAN_SCHEMA_RETENTION_DAYS` ago (0 disables) |
| API lifespan | Starts local embeddings when configured. Nothing that reads stored data: the query role is ensured lazily, and the datastore outbox table is created by the first record write |
| Worker lifespan | Runs the datastore outbox dispatcher; closes the reindex queue |

## Storage model

| Storage | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `datastore_tables` | Registry and JSON column schema for each logical table |
| Per-pod PostgreSQL schema | Physical record tables, constraints, indexes, and RLS policies. Born readable by the ad-hoc query role (schema `USAGE` plus a per-schema default privilege for its tables); a schema from before that heals on its first query |
| `datastore_files` | Hierarchical metadata, ownership, processing status, Markdown/index metadata |
| Object storage/local store | Original bytes, derived Markdown, images, and page renders |
| `datastore_signed_links` | Durable `/s/{code}` capability grants: object key, expiry, hit ceiling, and revocation. Redis still serves every fetch and keeps the spend counter; the row is what makes a link's lifetime a promise rather than a function of how the operator deployed Redis |
| Search tables/indexes | Chunks and embeddings used by PostgreSQL search/reranking |

## API groups

| Routes | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `/pods/{pod_id}/datastore/tables` | Create/list/get/update/delete tables and add/remove columns |
| `/.../tables/{table}/records` | CRUD, filter/sort/page, and bulk create/update/delete records |
| `/pods/{pod_id}/datastore/query` | Restricted ad-hoc datastore query under the RLS subject role |
| `/pods/{pod_id}/datastore/files` | Upload, folders, metadata/content update, Markdown attachment, tree, search, preview/download |
| `/public/datastore/files`, `/s/{code}` | Signed file delivery paths |
| `/pods/{pod_id}/datastore/changes` | Resumable WebSocket stream for authorized row changes |

## File lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING: upload metadata + bytes
    PENDING --> PROCESSING: worker claims file
    PROCESSING --> READY: extract, chunk, index
    PROCESSING --> FAILED: retryable error
    FAILED --> PENDING: recovery retry
    PROCESSING --> FAILED_PERMANENT: retry budget exhausted
    READY --> PENDING: content/Markdown changes
    READY --> [*]: delete metadata; async byte/index cleanup
```

The worker can use Kreuzberg/Xberg, MarkItDown, or Docling-compatible
processing. The HTTP adapter speaks both the Kreuzberg v4 and Xberg 1.x wire
formats — the response envelope, the removal of `POST /chunk`, and the
`layout.strategy` key are all handled in one client — so the engine can be
swapped by changing the image tag.

`DatastoreSettings` owns original, Markdown, attached-image, and request-batch
upload ceilings as well as document-processing controls.

### How ingestion is scheduled

Three mechanisms keep a bulk upload from harming the rest of the platform, and
guarantee every file is eventually processed:

- **Lanes.** Document processing runs on the `bulk` streaq queue, separate from
  the `interactive` queue serving agent runs, surface messages and workflow
  resumes. `WORKER_BULK_CONCURRENCY` is the real cap on concurrent extractions.
  This replaced an in-task semaphore that throttled extractions only *after*
  they had already taken a worker slot, so a burst starved interactive work.
- **Per-pod admission + fair dispatch.** Uploads beyond
  `DATASTORE_PER_POD_MAX_INFLIGHT` are deliberately not enqueued; the `PENDING`
  row in Postgres *is* the durable backlog. A per-minute cron
  (`dispatch_pending_datastore_files`) drains it round-robin across pods, so one
  tenant cannot monopolise ingestion and Redis depth stays bounded.
- **Attempt accounting that distinguishes cause.** A document-level failure
  spends one of the file's `datastore_recovery_max_attempts` and eventually goes
  terminal. Infrastructure unavailability — extractor down, 5xx, timeout, open
  circuit — instead calls `release_claim`, returning the row to `PENDING` and
  *refunding* the attempt. Without that split, three extractor blips were enough
  to mark a perfectly good user document `FAILED_PERMANENT`.

The recovery cron still reclaims stale `PROCESSING` rows and terminally fails
files that genuinely exhaust their budget.

Note that in practice **embedding, not extraction, dominates ingestion cost**
(measured at roughly 2.6x extraction on a 100-paper arXiv corpus), so worker CPU
sizing should be driven by the embedding backend.

## Authorization

- Table, record, and file services require a pod `Context` and apply role,
  resource-grant, visibility, ownership, and RLS rules.
- `/me` is a public alias for the current user's private file root; internal
  paths retain the user UUID.
- Signed URLs are purpose-bound, expire, and can have a Redis-enforced hit cap.
- The changes WebSocket filters emitted rows through the caller's visibility.

## Dependencies and consumers

Agents expose datastore/file tools; schedules consume record events; bundles
export/import schemas and seed data. The module uses identity/pod context and
publishes the shared `datastore_events` stream.

## Tests and operations

Tests cover schema/record validation, SQL safety, RLS, files, storage adapters,
document processing, recovery, signed URLs, WebSockets, and e2e CRUD. One
MarkItDown unit test is skipped when the optional package is absent.

# The GitHub App

Lemma reaches GitHub as a **GitHub App**, not an OAuth App. That choice buys
three things a classic OAuth App cannot: an identity that outlives the person
who set a schedule up, per-installation rate budgets, and one webhook URL that
delivers whatever the installation can see.

One App per environment. An App has a single webhook URL and a single callback,
so a development tunnel and production cannot share one — configure a separate
App for each, and give each its own `CONNECTOR_GITHUB_*` values.

## Creating one

[`config/github-app-manifest.json`](../../config/github-app-manifest.json) is
the source of truth for what the App needs. It is checked in so the permission
set is reviewable, and so a new environment is a copy rather than a memory
exercise.

**The manifest applies at creation, and only at creation.** GitHub keeps the
event subscription list on the App itself and reads the manifest once, while the
App is being created; nothing re-reads it afterwards. So shipping a build that
offers a new trigger does not subscribe an existing App to its event, and the
failure is the quiet kind: the trigger is offered, a schedule built on it is
accepted, and no delivery ever arrives. Tick the new event under **Permissions &
events** on the App's settings page before the build offering the trigger goes
out. A new environment needs nothing extra -- the manifest already has it.

```bash
uv run python scripts/create_github_app.py --name lemma-dev --base-url https://api.dev.example.com
uv run python scripts/create_github_app.py --name Lemma --base-url https://api.lemma.work --org lemma-work
```

Open the URL it prints and press **Create GitHub App**. That click cannot be
automated — GitHub gates App creation on a person, deliberately — but everything
else is: the script fills in the two per-environment URLs, exchanges GitHub's
temporary code, and writes the private key and an environment file — `0600` in a
`0700` directory — so nobody types a callback URL into a form and gets it subtly
wrong. We did exactly that twice by hand before this existed.

Neither secret is printed. A client secret on stdout outlives the terminal: it
lands in scrollback, in shell history when somebody pipes the command, and in a
log file whenever it runs under `nohup` or in CI. Move the two files somewhere
durable and load the environment file into the deployment.

The two URLs it fills in, which are deliberately absent from the manifest
because they differ per environment:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Callback URL | `<api>/connectors/connect-requests/oauth/callback` |
| Webhook URL | `<api>/webhooks/github` |

For local work `make dev-public` prints the public API URL to use for both.

## Why each permission

| Permission | For |
|---|---|
| `metadata: read` | Mandatory for every App |
| `contents: write` | Cloning, pushing, branches, and the sandbox's `git` |
| `pull_requests: write` | Opening, reviewing and merging pull requests, and receiving `pull_request_review` and `pull_request_review_comment` |
| `issues: write` | Issues, comments, labels, assignees |
| `actions: write` | Runs, re-runs, cancels, `workflow_dispatch` |
| `checks: read` | Reacting to `check_suite` |
| `deployments: write` | Approving pending deployments |
| `secrets: read`, `actions_variables: read` | Listing only — Lemma never writes either |

Secrets and variables are deliberately read-only. Nothing in the operation set
writes one, and an App that cannot write them cannot be made to.

## The two tokens, and which acts when

The App issues both kinds and Lemma uses both, on purpose.

**Installation token** — the App acting as itself, minted per installation and
valid an hour. This runs an agent's connector operations. A schedule keeps
working after its author leaves, and a webhook-triggered run has an identity
even with nobody present.

**User token** — the person acting as themselves, from the OAuth half of the
install. This runs the sandbox's `git`/`gh`, pod bundle publish and import, and
the fourteen operations GitHub marks as user-only (gists, `/user/...`). Work an
agent does in a checkout is attributed to the person whose repository it is,
which is the behaviour people expect from a tool that opens pull requests on
their behalf.

Which one an operation gets is not a setting. Every operation carries
`github_token_kind`, derived from GitHub's own `x-github.enabledForGitHubApps`,
so the answer comes from GitHub rather than from a list maintained here.

## Connecting an account

The catalog sends people to `login/oauth/authorize`, not to the App's install
page. That looks backwards and is not: `/apps/{slug}/installations/new` only
redirects back on a *first* install. Somebody who already has the App is shown
the configure page and never round-trips a code — which is every reconnect, and
every second person in an organisation. Authorizing always round-trips.

**Authorizing is not installing, and that is the whole difficulty.** A GitHub
App's user token reaches only the repositories the App is installed on, and
there is no way around it: `GET /user/repos` is not available to App user tokens
at all, so the only enumeration that exists is `/user/installations` and the
repositories under one. An account with no installation therefore holds a valid
token, for the right person, that can read nothing.

So a connect can end in four states, and the app is told which:

| State | What happened | What finishes it |
|---|---|---|
| `READY` | one installation, bound | nothing |
| `INSTALL_REQUIRED` | authorized, nothing installed | the install link below |
| `CHOOSE_INSTALL` | several installations reachable | the person picks one |
| `PENDING_APPROVAL` | `setup_action=request` — an organisation member asked | an owner approves |

The install link is `https://github.com/apps/{CONNECTOR_GITHUB_APP_SLUG}/installations/new?state=…`,
minted per use by `POST …/connect-requests/install`. **The `state` is
load-bearing.** Because the manifest sets `request_oauth_on_install`, installing
redirects back to the OAuth callback carrying `code`, `installation_id` and
`setup_action`, and GitHub preserves whatever `state` the link carried. Without
one the callback has no request to claim and rejects the only redirect that ever
names the installation — which is exactly how this flow used to dead-end.

That second leg has no PKCE: GitHub builds its authorize step itself, so there
is nowhere to put a challenge. It is bound by identity instead — the follow-up
request records which provider account is expected, and a code exchanged for
anybody else is refused. See `followup_attributes`.

The `installation_id` on the callback is never trusted as given. GitHub warns it
can be spoofed, and `external_ref` is the inbound routing key, so it is proved
with `GET /user/installations/{id}/repositories` under the token that just came
back before it is stored.

### Changes made on GitHub, seen without a reconnect

Nothing comes back when an organisation owner approves a request hours later,
and **nothing at all** when somebody edits an installation's repository list:
the manifest sets `setup_on_update: false`, and because `request_oauth_on_install`
is on the Setup URL field is disabled outright, so there is no URL for an update
to fire at even if it were flipped. There is no API to change repository access
with either — the endpoints that add or remove a repository from an installation
take a classic personal access token and nothing else.

So freshness does not rest on redirects. `GithubInstallationReconciler` asks
`GET /user/installations` with the account's own token whenever there is
something to learn: at the end of a callback, when the connectors page finds an
unbound account, and on an explicit refresh. A bound account costs no call.
Webhooks stay worth having as an accelerant; a dropped delivery costs freshness,
never correctness.

### What the App cannot do

Create a repository. `POST /user/repos` needs the OAuth `repo` scope and App
user tokens carry no scopes; GitHub marks the route unavailable to installations
as well. Neither identity can call it. Pod publish therefore requires the
repository to exist — `owner/name` to target an organisation — and says so when
it cannot reach one, rather than failing on a create that could never succeed.

## Reconnecting after the cutover

Migration `0029_github_app_reauth` marks every native GitHub account
`REAUTH_REQUIRED`. Tokens minted under the old OAuth App belong to an
application the deployment no longer holds the secret for — they cannot be
refreshed and cannot be revoked from here — and they carry no installation, so
nothing could mint an installation token for them.

The rows are marked, not deleted. Four things reference an account without a
foreign key to it: tool grants, a conversation's `metadata.repo.account_id`, pod
bundle bindings, and pod publish's required `account_id`. Deleting the rows
would silently break sandbox `git` and pod publishing for work that exists
today; reconnecting repairs them in place. Composio-brokered GitHub accounts are
untouched.

One consequence worth expecting: after the cutover the project picker lists only
repositories the App is installed on, which is usually fewer than a classic
OAuth App showed. Installing on more repositories is the fix, not a broader
scope.

## Triggers

The App has one webhook URL and its installation decides which repositories it
covers, so every event for every organization arrives at the same endpoint:

    POST <api>/webhooks/github

There is nothing to subscribe to per schedule — which is why provisioning a
GitHub trigger creates no remote subscription and says so explicitly rather than
doing nothing quietly.

What separates one schedule's events from another's is the routing key,
`{source, installation_id, event}`, bound onto the schedule when it is created
from the account and the trigger. `installation_id` is what makes it
tenant-scoped: without it a `pull_request` schedule in one organization would
fire on another organization's pull requests. A schedule may narrow further by
`repository_id` (numeric, so a rename does not break it) and by `actions`.

Deliveries are verified against `CONNECTOR_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, with
`..._PREVIOUS` accepted alongside it so a rotation is not an outage — a stream
of 403s is indistinguishable from an attack, and GitHub answers it by disabling
the hook.

Redeliveries do not fire a schedule twice. `X-GitHub-Delivery` is per-delivery
and GitHub issues a new one when it retries, so the idempotency key is derived
from the event's own content instead.

A pull request that fires an agent binds the conversation to the repository and
its head branch, and the clone runs as the schedule's connected account — the
person, not the App — so what the agent pushes is attributed to them.

## What a triggered agent needs beyond the connection

A connected account is not on its own enough for an agent to use `git` and `gh`
in its sandbox. A scheduled run is a *delegated workload*, and the workspace
credential bridge resolves the account through the same authorization the
connector tools use. Two grants are involved and only one of them is obvious:

| Grant | Given to | Why it is not enough on its own |
|---|---|---|
| `connector.use` on `github` | a **role** (POD_ADMIN, …) | Authorizes the *person*. A delegated workload is refused with `MISSING_WORKLOAD_RESOURCE_GRANT`. |
| `connector.use` on `github` | the **agent** (`PUT /pods/{pod}/agents/{name}/permissions`) | This is the one that carries a triggered run. |

Without the agent's own grant the failure is quiet in the way that matters: the
credential bridge resolves nothing, caches "unavailable" for the session, and
the checkout fails with git's own `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`
inside the sandbox. Nothing upstream logs an error, because nothing upstream
went wrong.

## Uninstalling

Nothing has to be subscribed for this, and nothing *can* be: GitHub rejects a
manifest that lists `installation` or `installation_repositories` --
"Default events unsupported" -- and delivers them to every App regardless.
Observed live before the rejection was known:
`installation.new_permissions_accepted` arrived twice while the App's `events`
contained neither. The nine trigger events do have to be subscribed; these two
must be left out.

An `installation` delivery with `deleted` or `suspend` retires what the
installation leaves behind: its accounts go to `REAUTH_REQUIRED` and its
schedules are deactivated with `deactivated_reason` recorded in their config.
Neither is deleted — reconnecting and reactivating is enough, and the routing
key survives so nothing has to be rebuilt.

Both are treated the same. A suspended installation issues no tokens and sends
no deliveries; the only difference is that it can be undone, and reconnecting is
how you undo it either way.

## Settings

| Env | Needed for |
|---|---|
| `CONNECTOR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` | The OAuth half — connecting an account at all |
| `CONNECTOR_GITHUB_APP_SLUG` | Sending someone to install the App |
| `CONNECTOR_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` or `_PATH` | Minting installation tokens |
| `CONNECTOR_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Verifying inbound deliveries |
| `CONNECTOR_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PREVIOUS` | Accepted alongside it, so a rotation is not an outage |

Without the private key everything still works as the user; only the
installation half goes quiet. Without the webhook secret, deliveries are
refused rather than trusted.

"""Is this CLI out of date, and can it upgrade itself?

**What it checks against.** The server, not PyPI. Releases are mono-version
(``docs/versioning.md``): one tag publishes ``lemma-terminal``, ``lemma-sdk`` and the
API together, so the release a server runs *is* the newest CLI it knows of. It
says so two ways: ``/health`` reports it (``api_version``, the same number
``lemma doctor`` reads for skew), and any response to a CLI older than that
carries it in ``X-Lemma-Latest-CLI``, which the SDK records for us. Neither
adds a host the CLI was not already talking to. The server only ever suggests;
it never refuses an older CLI.

**When it runs.** Never in front of a command. The ``/health`` check happens
after the command has finished, on a daemon thread with a short timeout
(telemetry's precedent, ``telemetry.py``), and all it does is record what it
saw. The notice is printed after the command too, from what was recorded or
from the header the command's own requests brought back, so no command ever
waits on the network to tell the user about an upgrade.

**How loud it is.** One dim line on stderr — stderr because ``--output json``
must stay pipeable — at most once a day while an upgrade is available. It is
suppressed where `lemma update` could not act anyway (see ``install_kind``),
because a hint that names a command that cannot work is worse than silence.

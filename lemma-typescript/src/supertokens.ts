         * on the auth portal's own `SuperTokens.init`, which only the `/auth`
         * routes reach. So the pages that make the most requests were the ones
         * still retrying ten times each.
         *
         * That is the amplifier, not the cause: a refresh can answer 500
         * forever when a browser holds two session cookies from a
         * cookie-domain change, and at ten attempts per request across the
         * queries a workspace screen makes, one install logged 30 refusals and
         * 17 500s before anyone looked.
         *
         * Three rather than two, and the extra one is not slack. An install
         * migrating off duplicate cookies spends both: the first refresh comes
         * back carrying only the clearing cookies and no new tokens, and the
         * second does the real refresh. At two, anything that consumes a third
         * -- a second tab racing the refresh lock, an access token expiring in
         * flight -- hits the ceiling, which the frontend reads as an
         * unrepairable session and signs the user out. The ceiling exists to
         * stop a session that cannot be repaired being hammered, not to fail
         * the one case it was raised for.

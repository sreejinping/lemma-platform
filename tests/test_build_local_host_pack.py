"""The producer half of the host-pack layout contract.

This file used to be two assertions about `npm_executable`, for a script that
lays out a 500 MB artifact the desktop app then hard-codes a dozen paths into.
Neither side had any idea what the other did, and neither could: a PR runs the
consumer's tests against a fixture the same PR wrote, while the pack itself is
built by a release job on a different trigger. A rename lands green on both
sides and is found by whoever installs the release.

The Rust half is
`native_host_pack.rs::the_packaged_layout_matches_the_committed_contract`, and
both assert against `desktop/contracts/host-pack-layout.json`.

"""The release announcement must be able to say a release did not happen.

The script exists because 0.7.2 looked like a release from every angle this
repository could see, and shipped no packages. So the test that matters is not
"does it format a nice message" -- it is that a half-published release is
reported as half-published, and that an index it could not reach is never
silently reported as a success.

"""Surfaces and notifications → a delivery Telegram would never have made.

Everything here is about what Lemma does with a delivery it should not simply
believe: one that is unsigned, one signed with the wrong secret, one it has
already handled, two of the same racing each other, one from somebody it has
never heard of, and one from somebody it knows perfectly well who has no place
in the pod on the other side.

That is why these take the forged lane and say so. A real account cannot send a
message twice with the same update id, cannot omit the signature, and cannot be
a stranger and a colleague at once — those are things only the platform does,
and a webhook nobody can route to from the internet is only as safe as its
refusal to believe whatever arrives at it.

The full happy path — somebody messages the bot and is answered in the same
chat — is `test_being_answered.py`, and it runs against a real account where
there is one.

    A stranger is stopped by the identity check, which the scenario above

    `@username` Lemma resolves, so every question about who they are answers
    cleanly. The only thing between them and the pod is that nobody put them in
    it — and a resolved sender looks in every way like a member until something
    actually asks.

    That is the boundary the specification insists on, in its own words: being

    both halves of what it says happens instead are asked for here — they are
    told how to get access, and the pod is still shut to them afterwards.

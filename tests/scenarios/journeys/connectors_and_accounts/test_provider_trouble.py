"""Connectors and accounts → when the third party is the thing that is broken.

A connector puts somebody else's server on the critical path of a pod. That
server will be down, and it will be slow, and neither is a reason for the pod to
be down or slow with it. The provider here really returns 500 and really hangs,
so what is being tested is Lemma's behaviour rather than a description of it.

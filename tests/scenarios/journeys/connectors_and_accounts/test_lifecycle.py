    Three requirements, and the third is the one that bites. One kind only, so
    installing it without saying which is unambiguous. Not OAuth2, because
    connecting one of those means a person in a browser. And **nothing required
    in its config schema**: installing is a single call with no configuration,
    so a kind that needs a host, a spec URL or a broker key answers 400 and the
    whole file fails on setup.

    That last one is why a preference for a connector that carries operations
    does not belong here. On a real deployment the two are close to disjoint —
    everything with operations wants credentials or an address first, and the
    ones that install unaided are messaging surfaces with none. Ranking on
    operations picked `sql`, which needs `dialect`, `host` and `database`, and

"""Agents and conversations → waiting for something to finish.

An agent with nothing to do until something else happens should cost nothing
while it waits. Before this existed the only way to wait was to keep asking —
a shell `sleep`, or the same tool over and over — and each ask was a whole model
call replaying the whole conversation to learn that nothing had changed.

What is under test is the product promise, not the mechanism: the turn ends, the
conversation survives, and the agent comes back on its own knowing why.

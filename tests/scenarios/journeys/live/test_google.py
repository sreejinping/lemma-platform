"""Live → Google, as far as a machine can honestly go.

Connecting Google means consenting in a browser. Google deliberately blocks
automated sign-in, so a scenario that drove the consent screen would be fighting
a defence Google maintains on purpose — and would be the flakiest thing in the
suite. This does not pretend otherwise.

What it does instead is test the half that *is* the deployment's responsibility
and the half that actually breaks: the connect flow it hands a person. A rotated
client, a missing scope, a redirect that no longer matches — those are silent
until somebody tries to connect, and they are exactly what this catches.

Using a connected Google account is the tier above, and it needs an environment
where somebody has already consented once. Point the lane at one:

    cd tests/scenarios && uv run pytest -m live --base-url https://your-lemma

"""Live → the everyday things a person asks the pod's agent for, and how long they wait.

The fast lane proves an agent run happens; it cannot prove one is quick,
because its model is scripted. This is the half only a real model answers:
the requests people actually make of a pod every day, each given the budget
PS-AGENT-016 promises and checked for having done the thing, not only for
having replied.

Each scenario makes its own data under a run-unique name, sends the request the
way the frontend does -- appended, not streamed, so the scenario's own request
timeout is never a ceiling on the model -- and waits for the run to settle. The
clock is the person's: from sending the message to the run being over.

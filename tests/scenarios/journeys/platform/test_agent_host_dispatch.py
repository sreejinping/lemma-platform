"""Platform → work dispatched to a paired Agent Host.

PS-AGENT-041 says dispatched work runs *exactly once*. Until now the only proof
was a refusal: an unpaired host is told no. This scenario walks the pairing in
the product's own order — mint a code, spend it, announce harnesses, bind a
runtime profile, pin an agent, start a run — and then asks the question the
promise is actually about: does the host claim the run once, however many times
it reads its queue?

The machine's side goes over the link WebSocket, as a real host does. Each
"poll" below is a fresh link: ``hello``, then one ``control`` frame, and every
command the answer or a push carried. A fresh link each time on purpose -- one
socket de-duplicates what it has already pushed, so only a new one can show
that an unacknowledged claim is handed out again, and under the same id.

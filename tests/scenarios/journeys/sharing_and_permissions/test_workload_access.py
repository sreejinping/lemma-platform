"""Sharing and permissions → what an agent may do, and for how long.

The scenarios here are about *workloads* rather than people: an agent acting in
someone's name is the sharpest edge in the product, because it is the one actor
that keeps working after the person has walked away.

Each of these drives a real agent run, on whatever model the deployment is
configured with, and says what a person would say. They used to inject the tool
call they wanted to see — which proved that Lemma refused *that call*, and never
that a sentence a person actually typed ended up refused. So they ask in words
and assert on what must be true afterwards: the record is still there, and the
person was told something.

The cost is that they need a model that can think, and skip with a reason where
there is not one. That is the honest trade: an agent scenario driven by a
scripted turn on a deterministic model is not evidence about the product a
person uses.

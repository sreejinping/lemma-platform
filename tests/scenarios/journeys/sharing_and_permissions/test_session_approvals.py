"""Sharing and permissions → approving once, and approving for a session.

"Approve for the session" is the setting people reach for when an agent keeps
asking, which makes its boundaries the thing worth testing: it has to stop the
asking inside this conversation and nowhere else. A session approval that leaks
into the next conversation, or into another person's, is a standing grant that
nobody knowingly gave.

These drive real approvals on a real model: the agent is *told* to ask before it
changes anything — which is what a person setting one up does — the run pauses,
a person decides, and the backend executes the action with that person's
authority. Asserted on effect, never on the agent's words: whether the row is
still there, whether the run came back to life, whether the person was asked
again. What a model says about any of that is its own business and changes every
time it is asked.

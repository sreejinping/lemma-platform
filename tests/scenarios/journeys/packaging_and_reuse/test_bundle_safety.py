"""Packaging and reuse → what a bundle must not carry, and must not be able to do.

A bundle is the one artefact of Lemma that leaves Lemma. It gets mailed around,
committed to repositories, and installed by people who did not build it — so
the two questions that matter are what it takes with it on the way out, and what
it can do to you on the way in.

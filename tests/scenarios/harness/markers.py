"""The vocabulary a scenario test uses to say what it is.

Five decorators, all thin wrappers over pytest marks so that everything pytest
already does — selection with ``-m``, ``-k``, ``--lf``, xdist distribution —
keeps working untouched.

``journey`` and ``capability`` are normally set once per module via
``pytestmark``; ``scenario``, ``proves`` and ``covers`` are per test.

These are read by two things that never import each other: ``reporting.py``
turns them into the run's output, and ``scripts/check_scenario_coverage.py``
reads them straight out of the source with ``ast``, so the traceability gates do
not need to import or execute the suite.

    something it depends on is missing, and each one runs and proves that
    promise in the fast lane, where `harness/stack.py` boots exactly that
    deployment on purpose.

    What they cannot do is run against somebody else's Lemma, because a healthy
    deployment is by definition not in the state under test — and nobody is going
    to break dev so a scenario can watch. Before this mark they reported as
    skips there, which put three permanent entries on a skip list people are
    meant to read. A skip is supposed to mean "this could have run and did not".

#: This scenario signs somebody new up.
#:
#: A deployment keeps its sign-up gates on — proof of work, verified addresses,
#: deliverability checks — so these scenarios can only run on a stack whose
#: gates are off, which in practice means one the suite boots. The mark is what
#: lets a run be split: `-m open_signup` against a disposable stack, and
#: `-m "not open_signup"` against dev, so the sign-up journey is proved on every
#: release instead of skipping wherever it matters.
#:
#: Enforced by `world.new_person()`, which refuses to sign anybody up in a
#: scenario that is not marked, fixtures included.

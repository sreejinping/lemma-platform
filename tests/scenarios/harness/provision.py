"""Build the standing tenant on a deployment, or put it back the way it was.

Run once per environment, never as part of a run. That separation is the whole
design: a run signs the cast **in**, and signing in passes none of the gates a
real deployment keeps in front of registration. Only this script ever registers
anybody, and it is meant to be run by a person who can see what it did.

Idempotent by construction — every step asks what is already there and changes
only what disagrees with `harness/tenant.py`. Run it twice and the second run
reports that it had nothing to do.

    uv run python -m harness.provision --base-url https://dev.example
    uv run python -m harness.provision --base-url https://dev.example --reset

`--reset` is the other half: it removes what runs have left behind — matched on
the `scn` mark, so it can only ever touch things a run made — and puts the
cast's roles back to what this module says they should be. For when a run dies
partway through and leaves somebody promoted.

## Deployments this process cannot register the cast on by itself

Signing up is not always possible from here. A deployment can put a
proof-of-work challenge in front of it, or require a verification email to be
read back before anything else works — gates this module has no business
knowing how to get past, because publishing how would be indistinguishable
from documenting how to defeat them in bulk.

`--authenticate-with path/to/module.py:function` replaces *only* the "get the
cast signed in" half with an external one. Everything after that — building
the organizations, the pods, the memberships — is unchanged and still runs
here, because none of that is gated by anything the replacement needed to get
past. The function receives the `World` and must return every `tenant.CAST`
label mapped to a signed-in `Person` (`Person.api.authenticate(token)` and
`Person.user_id` set — the same state `signs_up`/`signs_in` leave behind).
What it does to get there is its own business: `IdentitySteps.signs_up`,
`.requests_email_verification` and the rest all accept `**kwargs`, reaching
the raw request, for exactly this — an external caller can attach whatever a
particular deployment demands without this module ever needing to know what
that was.

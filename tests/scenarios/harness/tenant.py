"""The people the suite runs as, and what they are to each other.

A scenario suite that makes a new person, a new organization and a new pod for
every test never once exercises the situation every real user is in: a workspace
with history in it, colleagues who were already there, and an account that has
been used before. It also cannot be pointed at a real deployment, because an
organization cannot be deleted — every run would leave more of them behind,
permanently.

So the suite has a **standing tenant** instead. Vantage Freight is a freight
company that uses Lemma; Calder Retail is one of its customers, and exists so
that "somebody outside is refused" has a genuine outsider to be refused. The
cast are colleagues with settled roles, and they sign **in** rather than up —
which is what lets the same suite run against a deployment whose registration
gates are on, because signing in passes none of them.

Five of them are not an arbitrary number. They are the smallest cast that can
express every permission promise the specification makes: proving the last owner
may not leave needs somebody who is genuinely the last owner, and proving an
outsider is refused needs somebody who genuinely works somewhere else. The sixth,
Bea, holds no permission anybody asserts on; she is there to pay.

Nothing here is machinery. This module is the *declaration* — provisioning reads
it to build the tenant, and teardown reads it to put the tenant back — so the
two can never drift into disagreeing about what the tenant is supposed to be.

"""The scenario suite as a pytest plugin: its options, fixtures and hooks.

One session-scoped stack, one ``world`` per scenario. See ``harness/stack.py``
for what "stack" means and ``harness/world.py`` for why scenarios go through a
world rather than touching it.

A plugin rather than a `conftest.py` so a suite built on this one — a
deployment proving promises of its own — gets every fixture here by naming it,
``pytest_plugins = ["harness.plugin"]``, and changes what it needs through the
hooks in `harness/hookspecs.py` rather than by copying the fixtures. This
suite's own `conftest.py` is exactly that one line.

"""A disposable Lemma built from released images, for `--stack compose`.

The local stack (`harness/stack.py`) runs this checkout's backend as processes
on this machine: fast, and exactly the code under review. What it cannot say is
anything about the *images* a deployment runs. This is the other half: the
self-hosting Compose file in `deploy/compose`, brought up from a release — or
from any images you name — with its sign-up gates off, driven over HTTP, and
removed with its volumes afterwards.

That is what lets sign-up scenarios run on every release. A deployment keeps its
gates on, so they skip there; run them here instead, against the same images,
and run everything else against the deployment. See `make scenarios-split`.

Differences from `deploy/compose` as a person installs it, each on purpose:

- **A copy, in a temporary directory.** `bootstrap.sh` writes `.env` next to
  itself, and a test run has no business writing into the checkout.
- **No Caddy, no frontend.** The suite speaks HTTP to the API, published on a
  loopback port; TLS and the web app are not what these scenarios prove, and
  Caddy's fixed host ports would collide with anything else on the machine.
- **`ENVIRONMENT=testing` and every sign-up gate off,** so the target reports
  its posture on `/health/capabilities` and `OPEN_SIGNUP` resolves to yes.
- **Sandbox images are not pulled** unless `SCENARIOS_COMPOSE_SANDBOX=1` —
  gigabytes a sign-up scenario never touches.
- **Its own project and network names,** so it cannot join a real install's.

Images: `SCENARIOS_COMPOSE_VERSION` (a release, default the latest) or
`SCENARIOS_COMPOSE_MANIFEST` (a `lemma-local.json`), and any single one of them
replaced by `SCENARIOS_BACKEND_IMAGE` / `SCENARIOS_FRONTEND_IMAGE` or by a
`pytest_scenarios_configure_stack` hook setting `spec.images`.

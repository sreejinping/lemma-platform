"""The world one scenario runs in.

A scenario never touches the stack directly. It asks the ``world`` for people,
and the people do things. That indirection buys two properties that matter more
than they look:

**Isolation by construction.** The stack is shared across the whole session
because booting it costs tens of seconds. Every person, organization and pod a
scenario creates therefore has to be unique to that scenario, and no scenario
may assert on a total ("there are 3 pods") because another scenario's pods are
in the same database. ``World.new_person`` makes the unique thing the default
thing, so the correct pattern is also the shortest one.

**One place to add a driver.** A ``Person`` holds a driver, not a URL. When the
CLI and SDK drivers land, the same journeys run through them by constructing
people with a different driver — the scenarios do not change at all.

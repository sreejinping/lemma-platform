"""Boot the system under test, and hand back a URL.

This suite is black box: it drives Lemma over a real socket, exactly as the
frontend, the CLI and both SDKs do. Nothing here imports ``lemma-backend``'s
application code, and ``conftest.py`` asserts that.

What gets started, once per session:

* Postgres (with ``pgvector`` enabled — the baseline migration needs it),
  Redis, and SuperTokens, as containers.
* ``alembic upgrade head`` against that database, through the backend's own
  virtualenv. The uvicorn lifespan does not migrate, so without this every call
  fails on missing tables.
* The scheduler API, which the backend calls when a time schedule is created.
* The backend itself, under uvicorn.

Session-scoped on purpose. Booting this takes tens of seconds, so a
function-scoped stack would make the suite unusable. The cost of sharing it is
that scenarios must not assume an empty world: every scenario creates its own
people, organization and pod with unique names, and asserts on what it created
rather than on totals. ``World`` makes that the easy path.

Generalised from ``lemma-cli/tests/e2e/conftest.py``, which already does all of
this for the CLI suite.

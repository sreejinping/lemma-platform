#: What "settled" means to a scenario waiting for a run: either of the above.
#: `WAITING` was missing until a real model started asking for approvals of its
#: own accord — the scripted one only ever produced `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`, so the
#: gap sat behind the seam for as long as the seam existed.
#:
#: The distinction matters, and getting it wrong is silent: a helper that answers
#: approvals must treat `WAITING` as work still to do, or it returns the moment
#: the first question is asked and reports that nobody was asked anything.
SETTLED = FINISHED | PAUSED_FOR_A_PERSON


#: The scripted-model seam used to live here: a scenario passed the tool calls
#: it wanted through `conversation.metadata`, and a deterministic model made
#: them. It is gone, and deliberately.
#:
#: It proved that Lemma dispatched, authorized and approved *that call*. It
#: could not prove that a sentence a person actually typed ended up refused,
#: which is the promise. And against a deployment it was worse than useless:
#: `e2e_llm_mode` is `real` there, so the metadata was ignored in silence and
#: the scenario asserted a scripted model's behaviour against a thinking one.
#: One scenario in the live lane had been doing exactly that for months.
#:
#: What replaced it is the product's own lever: an agent's `instruction`. Tell
#: an agent to ask before it changes anything — which is what a person does when
#: they set one up — then say what a person would say, and assert on what must
#: be true afterwards. Scenarios that need this take `needs(MODEL_IS_REAL)` and
#: skip with a reason where there is no model to think with.

        Creating a conversation and sending a message are two calls: the create

        agent is never asked anything. Bundling them here means a scenario says
        "starts a conversation saying X" and gets what it asked for.

        ``under`` makes this thread a
        child of another, which is how a subagent's work stays attached to the
        conversation that delegated it.

        ``watching`` is the default because most scenarios do want to send a
        message the way a browser does, over the stream. Pass ``watching=False``
        when the scenario intends to *answer* the agent. Sending over the stream
        holds one HTTP request open for as long as the run takes, so the

        it works today only because a run that pauses for approval ends, and

        ceiling on the model, which is a race nobody chose and one the product

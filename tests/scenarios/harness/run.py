"""The mark one run leaves on a tenant that every other run also uses.

The standing tenant is shared: run 50 opens the same pods run 1 opened, and
finds 49 runs' worth of history in them. That is the point — it is the condition
a real user is in, and the old design could never produce it. It also means a
run can no longer assume it is alone, so two things have to be true of every
durable thing a scenario makes.

**It says which run made it.** `run.name("orders")` gives `orders_scn7f3a1`. An
assertion filters to that, so "the table I made is there" stays provable in a pod
holding forty other tables, and a failure says which run to go and look at.

**It says a run made it at all.** The `scn` mark is what lets cleanup tell the
suite's leavings from a person's work. On a deployment that distinction is the
whole safety story: a reset that matched on shape rather than on this mark would
eventually delete something somebody wanted.

#: Stamped into every name a run creates. Short, pronounceable in a failure
#: message, and specific enough that matching on it is safe.
MARK = "scn"

#: An underscore, because a table name may hold nothing else: the datastore
#: refuses anything but alphanumerics and underscores, and a mark that only
#: worked on the resources with relaxed rules would be a mark scenarios learn
#: to leave off. One separator everywhere, valid everywhere.
JOIN = "_"

#: Anything a run has ever made, from this run or any other. This is what
#: `make scenarios-reset` matches on, so it is deliberately anchored to the end
#: of the name: a person who names a table `scn_forecast` is not caught by it.
#: A trailing extension is allowed, because a file keeps one — `notes_scn7f3a1`
#: and `notes_scn7f3a1.txt` are both this run's, and matching only the first
#: would leave every uploaded file invisible to cleanup.
#: Cleanup matches a hyphen as well as the join, because the product derives
#: names from the ones we give it and slugifies them on the way. An agent
#: called `agent_c2a102_scn7f3a1` gets an auto-provisioned Resend surface named
#: `resend-agent-c2a102-scn7f3a1` (email_surface_provisioning.py), and the mark
#: survives the slug in spirit but not in the separator. Requiring the join
#: exactly meant those never matched, so nothing ever swept them: one standing
#: pod on a real deployment reached 163 orphaned surfaces, every one of them
#: still competing to receive inbound mail.

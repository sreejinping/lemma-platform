/** Signed in? Then this is not the page you wanted.
 *
 *  The root route is the marketing page, and it is server-rendered as such,
 *  because the visitor a cold first paint is for is a logged-out one. Who is
 *  asking cannot be known any earlier than this: every fact the session is
 *  decided from — the SDK's auth manager, the chosen API origin, the bearer
 *  token on localhost — lives in browser storage, which a server reads none
 *  of. There is no cookie on this origin to check and no honest server-side
 *  answer to give, so the page renders for the common case and steps aside
 *  once the browser knows better.
 *
 *  `replace`, not `push`: this was never a place in the history, and pushing
 *  it would make Back bounce off the redirect and strand somebody on it.
 *
 *  Only a settled yes leaves, and settling it means ending at `GET /users/me`
 *  rather than at the SDK's answer — see `signedIn`. Nothing is shown while it
 *  settles: a spinner thrown over a marketing page for the length of one
 *  request is worse than the page. Unconfigured stays, because with no API
 *  origin there is nothing to ask and the setup screen is a worse answer than
 *  the page explaining what this is; sample stays, having no session to be in.

/** Which screen a URL under the portal means.
 *
 *  The paths are not this app's to invent. The backend builds the reset and
 *  verification links itself, from `auth_website_base_path` (`/auth`) and
 *  SuperTokens' own conventions, and mails them — so `/auth/reset-password`
 *  and `/auth/verify-email` are a contract with emails already sitting in
 *  people's inboxes. `/auth/callback/{provider}` is the same kind of promise
 *  made to Google and Microsoft, registered with them as a redirect URI.
 *
 *  Which is why this is a table rather than a router: every row is a string
 *  somebody else is already holding.

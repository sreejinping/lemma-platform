/** The proof-of-work the API asks for before it will take an auth request.
 *
 *  Altcha is a hashcash: the server hands out a salt, a signature and a
 *  ceiling, and the browser finds the one number under that ceiling whose
 *  `SHA-256(salt + number)` matches the challenge. It costs a visitor a moment
 *  and costs somebody spraying an endpoint their whole budget.
 *
 *  **It is not optional when it is on.** `auth_abuse.verify_altcha` refuses a
 *  request with no proof — "Missing proof-of-work" — so a portal that skipped
 *  this would not degrade, it would simply never sign anybody in on a
 *  deployment that had it enabled. Whether it is on is the server's to say and
 *  is asked at `/auth/altcha/challenge`, which answers `{enabled:false}` when
 *  it is not.
 *
 *  Note the endpoint is on Lemma's own `/auth`, not under `/st` — it is not
 *  SuperTokens, it guards SuperTokens.

/** Tables for the sample source.
 *
 *  The sample had one table with two rows in it, which was enough to show that
 *  a grid renders and nothing else. A table's shape is the thing the library
 *  now reads to decide how to draw it, and two rows have no shape — so these
 *  are six tables that are each plainly something: prose, a series, a short
 *  list of work, piles, named things, and one that is honestly just a grid.
 *
 *  Dates are relative to the moment they are asked for. A deadline fixture
 *  written as a literal is a deadline that quietly becomes history, and the
 *  view that sorts on "within the month" would stop choosing itself some time
 *  after whoever wrote it stopped looking. */

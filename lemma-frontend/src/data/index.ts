/** Which source this browser gets, given what the deployment was built with
 *  and what the browser asked for.
 *
 *  Pure and exported so it can be tested: the rule below is a boundary, and a
 *  boundary nothing tests is a boundary that moves.
 *
 *  Live by default — this app exists to show your pods. The sample source is
 *  opt-in, for judging layout where there is no session to be had.
 *
 *  The browser override is a development affordance and is honoured only
 *  there. In a production build the deployment decides, full stop: sample mode
 *  is passed straight through `SessionGate` — that is the whole point of it,
 *  a mode with no backend to authenticate against — so a localStorage key that
 *  worked anywhere would be a way for anybody to skip the sign-in door on the
 *  real site and land in something that looks like the app. Fixtures are not
 *  somebody's data, so this is not a leak; it is a stranger being shown a
 *  convincing workspace that is not theirs and never was.

/** What went wrong, in a sentence worth putting on a screen.
 *
 *  The platform refuses in full sentences — `{ message, code, request_id }`,
 *  where the message is written for whoever is standing in front of it and
 *  usually says what to do instead:
 *
 *      This pod cannot be opened to everyone while its organization is not
 *      public. Ask an organization owner to open the organization first…
 *
 *  That is worth far more than anything this app could say about a 403, so it
 *  wins wherever there is one. But the SDK guarantees a `message` on every
 *  error, and where the body carried none it fills one in: the status's own
 *  name — "Forbidden", "Internal Server Error" — or, failing that, a string
 *  beginning "Generic Error:" with the entire raw body pasted into it. Printed
 *  in the UI, the first says nothing and the second is a JSON dump. So
 *  `problem.message` alone is not safe to show, which is the whole reason this
 *  file exists rather than the idiom being written out at each call.
 *
 *  Three sources, in order: what the platform said, then what the caller would
 *  have said, then — for a failure thrown by this app or by the sample source,
 *  which are already sentences — its own message.

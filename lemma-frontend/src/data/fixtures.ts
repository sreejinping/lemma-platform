/** One workflow opened, keyed by *name*, because `workflows.get` is.

 *  way `WorkflowResponse` sends them (api/schemas.py:414).
 *
 *  Three graphs the walk has to get right and one it has to survive. The
 *  linear one to prove the order is the wiring's rather than the payload's;
 *  the branching one because a decision's arms live in `config.rules`, not in
 *  `edges`, and a walk that misses that reports every arm as unreachable; the
 *  loop because its body edges back to it and a naive walk never returns. The
 *  fourth is a graph nobody could save through the API: a step nothing points
 *  at, a node id that is not there, and a row of nonsense where a node should
 *  be.

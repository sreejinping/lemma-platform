/** Reading the connectable-surface catalog.
 *
 *  `podSurfaces.available()` answers the question a connect button is really
 *  being asked: **how much work is this going to be?** It knows, per platform,
 *  whether a Lemma-run bot can answer with no account of yours, whether this
 *  organization has already spent its one claim on that bot, whether a guided
 *  setup exists, and what connecting your own account would involve.
 *
 *  All of that is on the wire and none of it is legible from a platform name.
 *  Four identical grey icons leave the difference between "one click" and
 *  "ask your Slack admin" to be discovered by clicking. The whole point of
 *  this file is that the effort is knowable **before** the click, so the UI
 *  can sort by it and say it out loud.
 *
 *  The backend is the authority on the rules; this only projects them:
 *    - `supported_credential_modes` containing SYSTEM means a Lemma-managed
 *      identity exists in this deployment. It is configured per environment,
 *      so it is never assumed from the platform name.
 *    - `system_claim.available` is whether this org can still take it. The
 *      shared identity is claimable exactly once per organization — which is
 *      why it is reported here rather than discovered as a failed save.
 *    - `managed_setup_available` is the guided path that ends with a bot of
 *      your own instead of a shared one.
 *
 *  Pure, so the rules are testable without a session. */

/** Who is on the shelf.
 *
 *  **This file is the placeholder.** Every entry here is meant to become a
 *  published pod bundle — the backend already has the whole surface for it
 *  (`pod_bundle`: export, publish, import), so hiring one becomes an import
 *  rather than an empty `pods.create`. Until those bundles exist, the shelf
 *  runs on this list so the flow can be walked and judged.
 *
 *  When the real ones land, the shape below is what a listing has to expose:
 *  a name, one honest line about the job, the archetype face, and — the part
 *  that does the persuading — what actually arrives with them. A listing that
 *  cannot say "a table, a schedule and an app come with this" is a prompt
 *  wrapper, and a shelf of those is how the GPT store died.
 *
 *  `seed` is the archetype's face. It is not stored on the pod: it picks the
 *  character, and the hire's own id is then searched for a variant landing on
 *  the same one. See `variantForCharacter` — your Follow-ups and mine are the
 *  same role and the same character, on two different pods.
 *
 *  The seeds are searched, not typed. Six arbitrary ones gave six versions of
 *  the same round body in six colours, which is the failure this whole shelf
 *  is supposed to avoid: at the size a card draws them, silhouette separates
 *  two candidates and hue does not.
 *
 *  They were searched again when the face stopped being a generated creature
 *  and became one of twenty-four sculptures: a different hash, so the old
 *  numbers no longer held and two of the six came out as Stack. Re-run the
 *  search against `characterForSeed` if that hash or the cast ever changes —
 *  nothing here fails loudly when a shelf goes back to showing duplicates.
 *  The characters are also chosen rather than merely distinct: Moon keeps the
 *  night shift, Grid keeps the ledger, Bloom is glad you are here. */

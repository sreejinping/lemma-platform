 *  a person who has already been invited is told to go and ask to be invited.

 *  Three rungs, closed to open, and the order is the point. An invitation is
 *  the most specific thing anyone can know about you, so it goes first. A
 *  domain match is next, because the company being here already is a better
 *  answer than making a second one beside it. Making one is last, and only

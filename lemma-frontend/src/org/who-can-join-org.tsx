/** Who may let themselves into the organization.

 *  question at the scale above, in the same place relative to the people it
 *  admits.
 *
 *  It is not the same control, though, and the middle rung is why: a pod opens
 *  to an organization that already exists, while an organization opens to an
 *  email domain, which is a rule that needs a second thing typed before it
 *  means anything. Picking it without one would save a rule that admits
 *  nobody, so picking it asks.
 *
 *  Owner-only, and everybody else reads it: a rule you cannot see is one you
 *  cannot ask an owner to change — and the refusal raised on a teammate's page
 *  ("ask an organization owner to open the organization first") sends people
 *  looking for exactly this.

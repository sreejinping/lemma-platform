> 💡 A page is a doc you write in, with ${bot} one keystroke away. Use this one as a playground — change anything, nothing breaks. Tick things off as you try them.

## Getting started

- [ ] **Add a block.** Type \`/\` on an empty line for headings, to-dos, tables, images, files and more. Try it on a new line under this list 👇
- [ ] **Move things around.** Point at a block and drag the ⋮⋮ handle beside it; the + adds a block underneath.
- [ ] **Nest pages.** Type \`/page\` to make a page inside this one. It opens straight away, and shows up here as a card.


## Working with ${bot}

- [ ] **Ask it to write.** Type \`/\`, choose *Ask ${bot} to write*, and say what you want. It writes it in place, where you asked.
- [ ] **Ask for a change.** Select some text and choose *Ask for change* — "make this shorter", "turn this into a table".
- [ ] **Talk it through.** *Ask*, in the bottom corner, opens a chat about this page. Its expand button makes it full size, with the page beside it.

## Comments

- [ ] **Comment on anything.** Select text and choose *Comment*. Threads sit beside the page; resolve them when they are done.
- [ ] **Ask a bot in a comment.** Mention it — \`@${bot} tighten this\` — and it reads the page, makes the change and answers in the thread. Switch it on once, on the bot's page: *Answers comments that mention it*.
- [ ] **Bring people in.** Mention someone with \`@\` and they get a notification.

## Live data and visuals

- [ ] **Show a table, live.** \`/table view\` picks one of your tables and lets you filter, sort and group it — or write SQL, joins included. It stays current; nothing is copied into the page.
- [ ] **Draw it.** \`/visualize\` asks ${bot} for a chart or a diagram, built from this page or your tables. \`/html\` embeds your own.

This one is drawn live, right here in the page — press Shuffle:

\`\`\`lemma-widget
${DEMO_WIDGET}
\`\`\`

## Sharing

- [ ] **Share**, top right, shows who can open this page and invites more people. Everything here is a plain file in your space, so your bots can read and edit it too.

## Status

On track. Next milestone: the first draft.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Owner | Due | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kick-off |  |  | Done |
| First draft |  |  | In progress |
| Review |  |  | Not started |
| Launch |  |  | Not started |

## Open questions

- [ ] What still has to be decided?

## Decisions

- What was decided, and why.

## Notes

If the work lives in a table, type \`/table view\` to show it here live rather than copying rows in — or ask ${bot} to keep this page up to date.

## Highlights

- What moved this week.

## Numbers

Type \`/visualize\` and ask ${bot} for this week's numbers as a chart, or \`/table view\` for the rows behind them.

## Blockers

- [ ] What is stuck, and who can unstick it.

## Next week

- [ ] What comes next.

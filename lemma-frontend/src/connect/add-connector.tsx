/** Pointing this organization at a server of its own.

 *  These are already in the catalogue and this app had no door to them: one
 *  entry per sort, standing for every server of that sort. So "which
 *  connector" is the wrong first question — the first question is what kind of
 *  thing you are connecting, and the entry follows from that.
 *
 *  The kinds are found by asking the catalogue which of its kinds are pointed
 *  somewhere, rather than by hardcoding three ids: the ids are catalogue data,
 *  and a deployment that renames or removes one should show what it has rather
 *  than three dead tiles. "Not brokered" was the old question and the wrong
 *  one — GitHub, Slack and the bots are `http` too, and whichever of them
 *  sorted first became "A REST API".

 *
 *  So the page keeps the moment and adds the morning. The three things under
 *  the face are the three that make a new teammate real — something to do,
 *  somewhere to be written to, and somebody else who can use them — and each
 *  one is an existing surface rather than a checklist item that ticks itself.
 *
 *  It is printed in the teammate's own field, the same colour their badge and
 *  their header band will be, which is the first time anyone sees it: the
 *  hiring floor runs on the app's accent because it does not belong to anyone
 *  yet, and from here on this pod does.
 *
 *  The face waves on arrival and holds `delighted` for as long as the page is
 *  up, because this is the one screen where that is the whole point, and waves
 *  again when you come back to it with a pointer or the keyboard. */

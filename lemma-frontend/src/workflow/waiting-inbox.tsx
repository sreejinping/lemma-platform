 *  asked it nowhere: a workflow that stops on a form assigned to a person can
 *  sit for days, and until now the only sign of it was a notification, which
 *  is a message that can be read and forgotten. A wait is not a message. It is
 *  a piece of work with this person's name on it, and it stays owed until it
 *  is answered.
 *
 *  Beside the bell rather than inside it on purpose. The notification panel is
 *  a log of things said to you, most of which are over; this is a queue of
 *  things not done. Folding the queue into the log is how the queue stops
 *  being looked at.

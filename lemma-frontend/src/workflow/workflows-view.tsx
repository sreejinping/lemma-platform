/** What this teammate has been told to do the same way twice.
 *
 *  A whole backend module with nothing in this app pointing at it: workflows,
 *  their shape, their runs, and the step history that is the only record of
 *  what a run actually did.
 *
 *  Three depths in one place, because a workflow on its own says nothing —
 *  the list, one workflow, and one run. Flat rows on a divider at every depth,
 *  like the agents list and the connector catalogue: a pod has a handful of
 *  workflows, and a bordered box round each makes the eye cross a border to
 *  get from one name to the next.
 *
 *  Nothing here draws the graph. `workflows.visualize` returns an entire HTML
 *  debugging page rather than a graph format, so there is nothing to compose
 *  with — and at this size a picture would answer worse than the list does.
 *  "How does this run" is a question about order, and the answer to a question
 *  about order is a column you read downwards. The run history beneath it is
 *  already drawn that way; the two now stack on the same spine, so a failed
 *  node named in the history is findable by eye in the shape above it.
 *
 *  Nothing here edits the graph either, and that is the same decision the
 *  agents list makes: a workflow is changed by asking the teammate to change
 *  it. A form over `nodes`/`edges` would be a worse graph editor than the one
 *  this product does not want to build, and it would throw away the reason —
 *  the conversation is where "why does this branch on 5000" keeps its answer.

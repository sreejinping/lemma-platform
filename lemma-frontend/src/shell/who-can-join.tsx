/** Who may let themselves in.

 *  It sits under the roster rather than in a settings screen, and that is the
 *  same argument "Runs on" makes: the list of who is here raises the question
 *  of who else could be, and an access rule read anywhere other than beside
 *  the people it admits is a rule nobody checks.
 *
 *  The rule is stated as an answer, not as a policy name. "INVITE_ONLY" is
 *  true and tells you nothing about what happens next, so each row carries
 *  what the rule *does* underneath what it is called — which is the part that
 *  decides between the two open rungs, where the difference is not who is
 *  allowed but whether anybody gets asked first.

/** Giving a teammate a way to be reached.

 *  The old flow was four identical grey icons and a modal whose only real job
 *  was to open a different app in a new tab. It never said what connecting
 *  would cost, because it never asked: `podSurfaces.available()` answers that
 *  per platform and nothing read it.
 *
 *  So this sorts by effort and says the effort out loud. One click where a
 *  Lemma-run identity can answer, about a minute where a bot gets made for
 *  you, and a trip to the settings app only where an account genuinely has to
 *  be authorised. Three different amounts of work should not look identical.
 *
 *  And it ends on the **address**. "Connected" is not what anyone wanted —
 *  they wanted somewhere to write to. So the finished state is the handle,
 *  large, copyable, next to a link that opens the conversation. */

/** The computer's screen.
 *
 *  A computer has one, and showing it is most of what makes this view read as
 *  a machine rather than as another file browser. It is dark in every theme
 *  for the same reason a real one is: an idle display is not a sheet of paper.
 *
 *  The glass holds the picture and nothing else. What the machine is doing is
 *  said underneath, where a caption belongs — it was written across the glass
 *  once, and anything drawn behind it fought the words.
 *
 *  **Drivable, with nothing to arm first.** This was view-only, on the reasoning
 *  that a stray keystroke could land in a browser mid-run. The relay had a
 *  driving lease for exactly that, and it was taken out again: it never covered
 *  the case it was written for and only ever cost the case it did reach. There
 *  is one browser per sandbox now, so two parties acting at once costs the
 *  teammate a retry — which is cheaper than a person watching a cookie banner
 *  they cannot dismiss on a machine that is theirs. A watch/drive toggle would
 *  only move that cost onto somebody who forgot to press it.
 *
 *  Connecting is always a click. Attaching starts a browser if none is running
 *  and holds the sandbox awake for as long as the socket is open, so a screen
 *  that connected on render would run a machine for anybody who left the tab
 *  open. It disconnects the moment this pane stops being the one on screen.

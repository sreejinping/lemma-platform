/** One paused `browser_sign_in`, answerable.
 *
 *  A teammate has stopped mid-run because a site wants a person. This is where
 *  that person goes: the teammate's own browser, drivable, pointed at the site,
 *  with the two buttons that let the run carry on.
 *
 *  **The answer is the part that must not be missing.** Nothing detects a
 *  completed login on its own — there is no polling, no cookie watch, no
 *  heuristic that closes this on your behalf. A surface that showed the browser
 *  without these controls would let somebody sign in and leave the teammate
 *  waiting for ever, which is precisely what this app did before: the card in
 *  the transcript linked out to another deployment's page and hoped it was
 *  there.
 *
 *  Control rather than watching, and no toggle to arm first. There is no lease
 *  to take: the sandbox has one browser, two parties acting at once costs a
 *  retry, and a retry is cheaper than a person staring at a password field that
 *  will not take their keystrokes.

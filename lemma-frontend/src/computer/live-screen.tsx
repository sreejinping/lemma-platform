 *  the scaling and the input capture, so there is no frame protocol here and
 *  no coordinate space to get wrong.
 *
 *  Two callers, one pane. Watching the machine is `view`, where the relay
 *  drops every keyboard and pointer message on the way past — enforced there
 *  rather than here, message by message, because a viewer that is not noVNC
 *  could otherwise smuggle a keystroke behind a legitimate frame. Signing in
 *  is `control`, where the whole point is that a person types.
 *
 *  Attaching **starts a browser if none is running and holds the machine awake
 *  for as long as it is open** — the idle sweep measures from the last request,
 *  and watching is not one. So this mounts on a click and unmounts the moment
 *  nobody is looking at it. It must never be rendered speculatively.

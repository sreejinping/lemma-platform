 *  released after fifteen idle minutes, so a pane that woke one on render
 *  would hold compute for as long as somebody left the tab open. The listing

 *  request both lists a directory and says where the machine keeps things —
 *  and a client that asks for nothing cannot ask for the wrong thing.
 *
 *  `wake` is a one-way door within a session: once somebody has asked for the
 *  machine to start, asking again with it off would answer `sleeping` about a
 *  machine that is plainly running, so the caller keeps it on.
 *

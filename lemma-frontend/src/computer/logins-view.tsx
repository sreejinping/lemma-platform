/** The sites your teammate's browser is signed in to.
 *
 *  It belongs on this view rather than in settings because it is a fact about
 *  this machine: the browser on the screen above is the browser these logins
 *  are in, and they survive a suspend because its profile lives in the durable
 *  home. That is the whole reason a sign-in is worth doing once.
 *
 *  Shut until somebody opens it, and nothing is asked for until then. Reading
 *  this costs a round trip into the sandbox — it is read from Chrome, not from
 *  a table — so rendering the door must not be what pays for the walk through
 *  it. `wake` is off for the same reason one step further out: opening a panel
 *  should not be what starts somebody's computer.

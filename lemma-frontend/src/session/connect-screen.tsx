/** The way in that does not involve a browser.
 *
 *  Not a failure screen, and that is the point. Showing this whenever the
 *  organization list comes back empty or errored tells a person whose network
 *  blipped, and a person on their first day who belongs to no organization
 *  yet, to go and find a bearer token. Those are three different things and
 *  they have three different screens.
 *
 *  This one is for the case it was always actually about: `localhost`, where
 *  the API's session cookie is cross-site and never sent, and agent testing,
 *  where there is no browser to sign in with. Reached deliberately, from a
 *  link, rather than arrived at by accident.

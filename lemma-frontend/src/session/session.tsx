/** Who is asking.
 *
 *  Before this, the answer was inferred from an unrelated query: the shell read
 *  `orgs.isError && /401|unauthor/` and, failing that, `orgs.data.length === 0`.
 *  The second half is the tell — somebody who is signed in and belongs to no
 *  organization is not unauthenticated, and showing them a box asking for a
 *  bearer token was the app confidently answering a question it had never asked.
 *
 *  The question has an endpoint. `AuthManager` calls `GET /users/me`, keeps the
 *  answer, and — this is the part worth knowing — the SDK's own HTTP client
 *  calls `markUnauthenticated()` on any 401 from any request. So a session that
 *  dies halfway through an afternoon turns this state over without anything
 *  here watching for it.

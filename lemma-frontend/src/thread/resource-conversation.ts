 *  that is not archaeology.
 *
 *  The binding lives in conversation metadata, which the list endpoint filters
 *  on directly (`?metadata.lemma_resource=table:invoices`). That is the whole
 *  mechanism: no second store, no naming convention to keep, and finding the
 *  conversation for a resource is one request.

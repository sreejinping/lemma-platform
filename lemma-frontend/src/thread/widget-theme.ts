/** What a widget is told about the pod it is drawn in.
 *
 *  A widget runs in an iframe on the API's origin, so it inherits nothing: not
 *  the theme, not the accent, not the faces. Left alone it renders in whatever
 *  it was written with and sits on a dark page glowing white.
 *
 *  The protocol is not ours to invent, and the first pass at this invented it
 *  anyway — `lemma-app-theme` carrying tokens named after this app's own
 *  variables. That is a real message type, but it is the one for **apps**, and
 *  the names were wrong besides, so every widget quietly ignored the lot and
 *  kept its defaults. The platform's `lib/assistant/widget-theme.ts` is the
 *  authority: widgets take `lemma-widget-theme`, and the vocabulary is
 *  semantic — `surface`, `muted`, `border` — never the host's own token names,
 *  because a widget is written once and drawn inside whichever host has it.
 *
 *  So this maps this app's palette onto those names. `lemma-app-theme` goes out
 *  alongside it because a widget runs the browser SDK, and the SDK registers a
 *  listener for that one the moment it finds itself framed; each side ignores
 *  the message it does not recognise. */

/** Why a run failed, in words the reader can act on.
 *
 *  A run on a coding agent fails in ways the backend describes in its own
 *  terms — a wait deadline, an unconfirmed delivery, a missing terminal event
 *  — which is exactly right in a log and meaningless on a conversation. Those
 *  are said again here as what happened and what to do, and marked
 *  `codingAgents` so the card can offer the settings where the computer and
 *  its agents are. Anything else is already a sentence and passes through.
 *
 *  The reason is the run's own (`last_run_error`), so it reads the same after
 *  a reload as it did live. */

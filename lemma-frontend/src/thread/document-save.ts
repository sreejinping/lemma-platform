/** When a document on the stage is written back, and what the reader is told.
 *
 *  A document here saves itself. There is no Edit button and no Save button:
 *  you click into the prose and type, and a second later it is on disk. The
 *  alternative — a mode you enter and leave — asks somebody to declare an
 *  intention they have already demonstrated by typing, and it puts a modal
 *  state on a surface whose whole point is that it is just the document.
 *
 *  That is a promise about *markdown only*, and the reason is in
 *  `editableKind` below.
 *
 *  Kept apart from the editor because these are decisions rather than
 *  rendering, and because the test runner strips types from `.ts` and cannot
 *  load a `.tsx` at all — anything living beside JSX in this app is untestable.

 *  the editor's own dialect — a `*` bullet becomes `-`, a setext heading
 *  becomes `##`, trailing whitespace goes. For prose that is harmless and
 *  nobody notices. For a file where the exact bytes are the point — a JSON
 *  config, a CSV, a log — it is damage, and it would arrive silently on a
 *  700ms timer. So those stay a `<pre>` you can read and download.

 *  out — and the file the reader is looking at is exactly the kind an agent
 *  writes that way, because this app renders agent HTML on purpose (see
 *  `markdown.tsx`).
 *
 *  Losing it would be silent, permanent, and triggered by a single keystroke
 *  landing on a 700ms timer. So a document with markup in it is read-only
 *  here, and says so. That is a smaller thing to explain than a report whose
 *  status strips vanished while somebody fixed a typo.
 *
 *  Code is stripped before the check. A document *about* HTML — a fenced
 *  example, an inline `<div>` — is prose, and refusing to let anybody edit it
 *  would be the check misreading its own subject.

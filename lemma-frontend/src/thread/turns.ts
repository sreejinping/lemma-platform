/** Turning a stream of messages into something a person reads.
 *
 *  A conversation is a sequence of TURNS. A turn is one person's message and
 *  the response to it: ask → work → result.
 *
 *  **Everything a turn shows is ONE list, in the order it happened.** That is
 *  the rule this file is built around, and it was learned the hard way — twice,
 *  here and upstream. Speech, cards and questions in three buckets drawn one
 *  after another puts a question the run is *blocked on* above the widget it
 *  was asking about, and strands an approval at the bottom of the pane far
 *  from the work that raised it. Chronology fixes both by construction: the
 *  run is paused at the ask, so nothing can come after it.
 *
 *  The trace is the deliberate exception. Reasoning and tool calls collapse
 *  behind one status line, because that is work rather than conversation.
 *  Speech never joins them: an intermediate "let me check the table first" is
 *  something the teammate said to you, and demoting it into a trace row
 *  labelled "Said" hid half a conversation behind a disclosure triangle.
 *
 *  Transport is the SDK's job (`useAssistantSession`). This file is only about
 *  presentation, which is why it takes plain messages and returns plain data
 *  with no client in sight. */

/** The card a run stops at.
 *
 *  **Three states, kept apart, because they are three different facts.**
 *
 *  `deciding` is the POST, and it is short — a button holds a spinner against
 *  it. `submitted` is everything after: the decision is recorded and durable,
 *  and what remains is the server running the thing that was approved, which is
 *  allowed to take minutes. `resolved` is the tool return actually landing in
 *  the transcript.
 *
 *  Collapsing the middle state into the first is what makes a card like this
 *  feel broken: you click Approve, the card vanishes, and nothing replaces it
 *  for ninety seconds while a tool runs. Collapsing it into the last is worse
 *  — the buttons stay live and a second click posts a decision against an id
 *  that is already answered.
 *
 *  A resolved card never disappears either. "Approved once" sitting in the
 *  transcript at the point it was approved is the record of what you agreed
 *  to, and scrolling back to find it is a reasonable thing to want to do.
 *
 *  **Open and answered are drawn for two different readers.** While the run is
 *  blocked the card is a control, and it is shown docked above the composer by
 *  `InteractionDock` — every option in front of you, at the width of the box
 *  you would otherwise be typing into. Once it is answered it is a record, and
 *  a record does not need the options that were not taken: the questions
 *  collapse to what was asked and what you said. Redrawing the whole form
 *  greyed out instead means, for a two-question ask, nine boxes of dead
 *  controls standing in for one sentence of history. */

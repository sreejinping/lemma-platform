/** Reading the tool calls that deserve to be seen.
 *
 *  An agent here has around forty tools. Five of them had a rendering and every
 *  other one collapsed to the same grey line — the tool's name and a
 *  hundred-character summary of its arguments — which is how a terminal session,
 *  a page of search results and a run that is deliberately asleep all ended up
 *  looking identical to each other and to nothing.
 *
 *  Everything here is a read of a **wire value**. The arguments are whatever the
 *  model emitted and the result is whatever the backend serialised, so every
 *  field is guarded and a shape that does not fit returns `null` — which puts
 *  the call back on the generic grey line rather than taking the transcript
 *  down with it.
 *
 *  The return shapes are the backend's, in `app/modules/agent/tools/`:
 *  `browser/models.py`, `workspace_cli/models.py`, `web/models.py`,
 *  `connectors/pydantic_adapter.py` and `waiting/models.py`. A local coding
 *  agent's calls arrive through the Agent Host already in the canonical
 *  vocabulary of `docs/architecture/agent-host-events.md` ("Canonical tools"),
 *  which is where the file, search and sub-agent cards read their shapes. */

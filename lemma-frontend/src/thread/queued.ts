 *  at its next step, a local coding agent that can be steered within a second
 *  or two, or otherwise the follow-up turn once this one ends -- the teammate
 *  has not seen it. The server says which is which in the message's metadata
 *  (`lemma-backend/app/modules/agent/domain/queued_messages.py`), and the claim
 *  arrives on the live stream as the same message with that metadata updated.
 *
 *  Drawn inline at its sequence, a queued message split the running turn in
 *  two: everything the teammate said after it -- still about the *previous*
 *  message -- landed under it, as though it were the answer. So while it waits
 *  it sits above the composer instead, labelled as waiting, where it can be
 *  taken back; and once delivered it joins the transcript where the teammate

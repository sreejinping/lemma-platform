/** The one door from this page into the Lemma desktop shell.
 *
 *  The shell loads the workspace from a remote origin — the locald-served
 *  `app.lemma.localhost`, or the hosted site — and Tauri lets such an origin
 *  call only the commands `desktop/capabilities/workspace.json` grants it.
 *  Every call from this app goes through `invoke` below, and `invoke` accepts
 *  only the names in `WORKSPACE_COMMANDS`, so a command the shell would refuse
 *  cannot be written here without the type checker, and then
 *  `tests/desktop-ipc.test.ts`, saying so. Nothing else in `src` reads
 *  `__TAURI__`; the same test holds that too.
 *
 *  Two globals, two different questions. `__TAURI__` is the bridge: present
 *  means this page can talk to the shell. `__LEMMA_DESKTOP__` is what the shell
 *  says about itself — version, mode and platform — injected by
 *  `desktop/src/appearance.rs` before any page script runs, and never removed.
 */

/** What the shell says about itself.
 *
 *  `mode` is baked into the window's initialization script when the window is
 *  built, and choosing local or hosted afterwards does not rebuild it — so for
 *  the rest of that session it can still say what was true at launch. Read it
 *  only for the question it is reliable for (which sign-in the shell expects);
 *  whether the stack here is local comes from the deployment, which the
 *  frontend that stack serves cannot be older than. `platform` is
 *  `std::env::consts::OS` and cannot go stale. Optional, because locald serves a
 *  frontend pack that updates independently of the shell, and an older shell
 *  never injected it. */

 *    by `app.lemma.localhost` is third-party and gets no cookies -- measured,
 *    and no cookie attribute changes it. The same host on another port is
 *    same-site, so the shell hands back an alias on the workspace's own host
 *    (`app_frame_url`) and that is framed instead.
 *  - `window`: macOS on `*.localhost` without a shell that can alias -- one too
 *    old to say its platform, or reached from somewhere it will not answer.

/** Connect this computer to the workspace on screen, without being asked.
 *
 *  Pairing exists because a workspace can drive agents on machines it does not
 *  run on: name the computer, mint a code, carry it over. None of that applies
 *  to the machine you are sitting at — you are already signed in on it, and
 *  the Agent Host is a sidecar this app supervises. A "Connect this computer"
 *  button asked for consent that was already implied, and read as broken:
 *  pairing takes a moment and the agent scan longer, so pressing it looked
 *  like nothing, then nothing, then "no agents found".
 *
 *  So it happens on its own, once per workspace per page load, as soon as the
 *  authenticated shell is open in the app — hosted workspaces included, since
 *  the cloud user is the one whose laptop and workspace are genuinely apart.
 *  There is no Connect, no Turn on and no Disconnect for this computer, so
 *  nothing fights the automatic connection. Pairing grants nothing by itself:
 *  a workspace reaches an agent only through a runtime profile somebody adds on
 *  the Models page, which is the real consent step.
 *
 *  macOS may raise a file-access prompt the first time an adapter probes for an
 *  installed agent. That belongs to the agent's own binary and cannot be
 *  pre-empted; connecting early at least puts it in front of someone still in
 *  setup. */

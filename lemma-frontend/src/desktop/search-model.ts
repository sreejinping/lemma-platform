 *
 *  Read from the backend's `/health/capabilities` (`capabilities.embeddings`).
 *  The model is downloaded once, on first run, so "Downloading…" is the state
 *  somebody sees on a fresh install, and "Couldn't download" the one they see
 *  offline — neither is a fault with their files, and the row says so.
 *  `disabled` (search embeds through a provider, not on this Mac) and anything
 *  unrecognised show no row at all.

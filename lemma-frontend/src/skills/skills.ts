 *
 *  Skills are a real thing in this product and nothing in this app has ever
 *  shown them. The Profile had a section headed Skills that listed the
 *  agent's *toolsets* — `WORKSPACE_CLI`, `BROWSER` — with a meta line counting
 *  `allowed_actions`, which are permissions on an agent row. Neither is a
 *  skill. A skill is a folder under the pod's `/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` in
 *  it, and the teammate reads it when the work calls for it.
 *
 *  This module is the reading, kept pure: a library listing and the text of
 *  each `SKILL.md` go in, and cards come out. Nothing here fetches, so every
 *  rule about what counts as a skill is testable against a payload nobody has
 *  to be online to produce.

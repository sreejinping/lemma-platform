/** A teammate's skills, as a hand of cards.
 *
 *  Cards rather than rows, and this is the one section on this page where that
 *  is the right answer. The lists around it — agents, workflows, schedules —
 *  are flat rows on a divider because each is a name you scan past on the way
 *  to the one you wanted. A skill is not that. A pod has a handful, each is a
 *  discrete named capability with a sentence explaining itself, and together
 *  they are the most concrete answer there is to "what can this teammate
 *  actually do". That is a hand you deal through, not a list you scan.
 *
 *  So they behave like cards. They sit in a track you move along, they have a
 *  rank in the corner, and they turn over: the front is what the skill is, the
 *  back is where it lives. One gesture, done properly, rather than three
 *  half-done — the flip is the whole conceit and the hover lift is just enough
 *  to say the thing is liftable.
 *
 *  It shares the badge's idea without borrowing its clothes: the badge is
 *  identity *issued* and prints at full strength in the teammate's own field
 *  colour, one figure on the page. A hand of five in that colour would be five
 *  figures shouting, so a skill gets a band instead of a field — the same
 *  seeded hue the app tints every other mark with, four pixels of it.
 *
 *  Three things this must not stop doing, whatever else changes:
 *  every card is reachable with a keyboard, the track never pushes the page
 *  sideways at 375px, and a skill whose SKILL.md could not be read still gets
 *  a card saying so instead of being quietly left out of the deck.

/** Reading a SKILL.md the way the thing that loads it reads one.
 *
 *  A skill is a directory under the pod's `/skills/<name>/` holding a
 *  `SKILL.md`, and that file has to open with YAML frontmatter delimited by
 *  `---` carrying `name` and `description`. None of that is convention: it is
 *  `_parse_frontmatter` in the backend's `agent/tools/skills/skill_loader.py`,
 *  which raises on every one of those rules — and `_build_pod_skill_catalog`
 *  catches the raise and moves on. So a pod skill that breaks one of them is
 *  not a skill with a blemish on it. It is a folder the teammate cannot see.
 *
 *  This is deliberately a copy of that parser rather than a lenient YAML read.
 *  Being generous here would draw a confident card for something the agent
 *  will never load, which is a subtler version of the bug this section
 *  replaced — a heading saying Skills over things that were not skills.
 *
 *  What it does differently is refuse to throw. The loader's job is to skip
 *  the broken one; this page's job is to show it, because the person who can
 *  fix it is the one reading. So every rule returns a sentence instead, and
 *  whatever could still be read is handed back alongside it.

/* Turn `.next/standalone` into a tree that runs on its own.
 *
 * `LEMMA_STANDALONE=1 npm run build` has Next trace every route and copy what
 * those routes import. It cannot see the custom server: `server.mjs` and the
 * voice gateways beside it are not routes, nothing Next builds imports them,
 * and so neither they nor `ws` and `@google/genai` -- which only they use --
 * reach the standalone output. A tree without them starts Next's generated
 * `server.js`, which serves pages and answers every voice call with a 404.
 *
 * So they are traced here with the same tracer Next uses, and copied beside
 * the server Next wrote. `public/` and `.next/static` are copied too: Next
 * leaves both out on purpose (a CDN is expected to serve them), and the
 * desktop app has no CDN. The result is what the host pack copies whole.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/complete-standalone.mjs   (after a LEMMA_STANDALONE=1 build)

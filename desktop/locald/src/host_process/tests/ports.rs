//! A port held idle, and what it must not answer.

use super::*;

/// A port nothing is serving must not accept a connection.
///
/// locald holds the workspace ports while the stack is down so nothing
/// else takes them. It held them with a *listening* socket, and a
/// listening socket with nobody accepting completes the handshake and then
/// says nothing at all. Everything that asks "is the backend up yet?" --
/// locald's own health gate first among them -- connected successfully and
/// then waited until it gave up.
///
/// Seen on Windows as `backend failed health gate: connection timed out`,
/// which is the same message a slow machine produces and points at
/// nothing. `netstat` showed lemma-locald LISTENING on both workspace
/// ports with no python or node process alive, and a connection to them
/// succeeding in 0 ms.
///
/// The test does both halves, so the difference is the assertion rather
/// than a claim about it. It asserts only that the held port does not
/// *accept*: whether the refusal arrives as a reset or as silence is the
/// platform's choice, and macOS drops the SYN where Windows resets.

//! What Lemma leaves on the Mac's disk, and when it takes it back.
//!
//! Three things grew without bound. The APFS clone of the data disk taken
//! before each migration (`data.raw.before-migration`) stayed for ever -- tens
//! of gigabytes once the live disk had diverged from it. Container images of
//! every earlier release stayed inside the guest. And the guest's freed blocks
//! stayed allocated in `data.raw`, a sparse file that only ever grew.
//!
//! The rules live here as pure functions, so each can be asserted without a
//! disk, a VM or a clock; `daemon::disk_ops` is what applies them.

//! The Mac's end of the loopback relay: the paired user's VM browser reaching a
//! server on this computer's `127.0.0.1`.
//!
//! With host execution the paired user's agent runs `npm run dev` on the Mac, and the
//! browser it checks the result with runs in a sandbox in the guest. The
//! sandbox's `host_fallback` proxy sends a loopback port nothing in the sandbox
//! serves to guestd, which forwards it over vsock to `lemma-vz`, which connects
//! here. The path, and who can use it, is described in
//! `docs/architecture/desktop-security.md#the-loopback-relay`; this end decides
//! *what* can be reached.
//!
//! The protocol is one line, then bytes: the port and a newline in; `ok` and a
//! newline, then the stream, or `error <reason>` and a close, out.
//!
//! What it will connect to:
//!
//! - **Nothing, unless "Run commands on this Mac" is on for this Mac's Agent Host.**
//!   The relay exists so the paired user's agent can check a server it started on
//!   the Mac; with host execution off there is no such server to check, and
//!   the relay admits nothing. Read from the Agent Host's config on every
//!   connection (see [`HostExecution`]), so turning the switch off closes the
//!   relay for the next request without a restart.
//! - **Loopback only.** `127.0.0.1`, then `::1` -- a dev server started with
//!   `localhost` binds whichever one the resolver gave it first. Never a name
//!   and never another address: the request carries a port and nothing else.
//! - **Not a privileged port.** Below 1024 on a Mac is the system's, and
//!   nothing a person starts with `npm run dev` binds one.
//! - **Only a server the agent started.** Every process listening on the
//!   port must descend from the Agent Host process locald supervises -- the
//!   exec-server and the coding agents it runs, and whatever they start (see
//!   [`owner`]). Anything else on the Mac's loopback -- the person's own
//!   database, a local admin page, a password manager's helper -- is refused
//!   whether or not anybody thought to list it.
//! - **Not one of Lemma's own ports.** The backend, the frontend, the private
//!   service forwards, the sharing gateway and its tunnel's local API, the
//!   Agent Host's MCP relays -- asked for afresh on every connection (see
//!   [`LemmaPorts`]), because several are chosen at run time and one that
//!   starts after this relay must still be refused. The paired user's own sandbox is
//!   still a place web content runs, and a page that could make it fetch
//!   `localhost:<backend>` would be talking to Lemma with nobody's session.

//!
//! - It has to work when `Daemon::new` cannot be constructed. That is the state

//!   from a build that no longer runs, an infrastructure secret that no longer
//!   opens the database. A verb on a daemon that cannot start is not reachable.
//! - The OS credential vault keys each item's access control to the code
//!   identity that created it -- `work.lemma.locald`, fixed by the `Info.plist`
//!   linked into this binary. A delete issued from the Tauri shell is a
//!   different program as far as the vault is concerned.

//! Stopping a run has to be a request before it is a killing.
//!
//! The host used to answer `CANCEL_RUN` by aborting the run task and killing
//! the adapter's process tree. That ends the turn, but it ends it at the worst
//! possible moment: the provider has not yet written the session file that the
//! conversation's *next* turn loads, so cancelling one message could silently
//! cost the conversation its whole history. ACP has `session/cancel` for
//! exactly this — the agent stops its own turn and reports `cancelled`.
//!
//! These run the shipped binary against `tests/fixtures/scripted_acp_agent.py`
//! in `cancel` mode, which works until it is told to stop and then acknowledges
//! over the wire. A host that skips straight to the kill never produces that
//! acknowledgement, which is what separates the two paths here.

/// `published=Some(..), start_sent=true, events=[]`. Roughly one run in twenty,
/// on CI and locally, and it never reproduced on demand.

/// now. On the link a command is lost with the connection it was pushed on, so
/// that is how it is lost here: the stub closes the link instead of sending the
/// first frame that carries it, and the host has to reconnect and be offered it

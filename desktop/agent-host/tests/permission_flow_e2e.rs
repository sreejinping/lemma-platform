//! An ACP agent asks to use a native tool; can Lemma actually answer?
//!
//! The host used to reply `Cancelled` immediately, so every native tool call
//! was denied and no decision could ever be delivered. The fix parks the ACP
//! responder in `PermissionGate` and answers it from a `RESOLVE_PERMISSION`
//! command. Unit tests cover the gate's own bookkeeping; what was missing is
//! proof that the round trip works through the shipped binary — the request
//! reaching Lemma as an event, the decision arriving as a command, and the
//! agent *continuing* afterwards rather than being stuck or cancelled.
//!
//! These are hermetic: the ACP agent is `tests/fixtures/scripted_acp_agent.py`,
//! which refuses to end its turn until its permission requests are answered.
//! `real_harness_e2e.rs` runs the same shape against a real agent asking for a
//! real shell command.
//!
//! Concurrency gets its own case because Claude Code issues parallel tool
//! calls, so two requests can be parked in one session at once and must not
//! answer — or overwrite — each other.

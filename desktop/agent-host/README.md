# Lemma Agent Host

Lemma Agent Host is the durable local boundary between a Lemma runtime and
user-owned coding agents. It lets Lemma use Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and
OpenCode without putting a provider credential in Lemma Cloud or maintaining a
custom parser for every provider CLI.

Agent Host is intentionally a separate native process. Lemma Desktop supervises
it through `lemma-locald`; headless installations can run it in the foreground
or install a per-user operating-system service.

How Desktop supervises, controls, and reports it - including the privilege
boundary for the workspace page - is in
[Agent Host in the desktop app](../../docs/architecture/agent-host.md).

## Architecture

    B <-->|"loopback relay"| H
    D["Lemma Desktop"] --> LD["lemma-locald"]
    LD -->|"supervise + diagnose"| H
```

Everything between the host and Lemma travels on one WebSocket per paired
workspace -- commands down; events, checkpoints and harnesses up; and the
agent's calls to Lemma's own MCP tools, which the adapter-private `mcp-bridge`
hands to the host over a loopback relay. See
[The link](../../docs/architecture/agent-host.md#the-link) for the frames, close
codes and delivery rules.

What the host reports is already normalized: one module per adapter under
`src/normalize` turns each agent's ACP shapes into typed events -- a tool call
named `exec_command` whether the agent called it `Bash` or `shell`, announced
once its input is final. See
[Agent Host run events](../../docs/architecture/agent-host-events.md), and
"Golden transcripts" there for how the normalizers are held to real adapter
output.

The control-plane transport is at-least-once. Before any provider side effect,
Agent Host writes the command, lease epoch, dispatch intent, checkpoints, and
event sequence to a SQLite WAL journal. The server fences every run with a lease
epoch and de-duplicates the append-only event stream. If the host dies after a
prompt may have been dispatched, the run becomes `DISPATCH_UNKNOWN`; Lemma does
not silently repeat it.

### One conversation, one provider session

A Lemma conversation maps to a single Codex/Claude Code/OpenCode session for its
whole life, so the agent keeps its own history instead of meeting the user again
on every message. Each run is a fresh process; continuity comes from the session
id, not from a held connection.

The host opens the session and journals its id with the dispatch intent.
`pending_control` puts that id on *every* checkpoint the run reports — a run has
one pending-checkpoint slot, so pinning it to a single checkpoint loses it to the
next state change. Lemma stores it against the conversation and returns it as the
next run's `resume_session_id`; the host then sends `session/load` rather than
`session/new`.

Three properties this depends on:

- **A failed load starts a new session, and the prompt brings the history.**
  Providers expire sessions on their own schedule, so a stale id is normal
  operation. Lemma only sends the latest message when it knows the agent can
  resume; when it cannot — a harness with no `loadSession`, or a session the
  provider has forgotten — the prompt carries the conversation instead, so a
  fresh session is a fresh session rather than an amnesiac one.
- **Replayed history is dropped.** `session/load` streams the whole prior
  conversation back before returning. Lemma already has those turns, so session
  updates are suppressed until this run's own prompt is dispatched.
- **The id is scoped to its harness.** A Codex rollout id means nothing to Claude
  Code, so a conversation moved between harnesses starts fresh rather than
  failing a load every turn.

Profile configuration and the model are re-applied to a resumed session exactly
as to a new one, so editing a profile still takes effect on the next turn.

### Messages sent while a turn is running

ACP's `session/prompt` is one request per turn and v1 cannot add to it. The
Claude Code and Codex adapters both implement the `_session/steering` extension,
advertised in `initialize`'s `_meta`; the probe publishes it as the harness
capability `steering`, and Lemma sends `STEER_RUN` only to a harness that has
it. The run's driver sends each steer once its prompt is out and reports a
`steer_result` event saying whether the adapter `injected` it. Anything short of
that -- an adapter without steering, a turn that ended first -- is reported as
undelivered, and Lemma's follow-up turn carries the message instead. See
[agent-host-events.md](../../docs/architecture/agent-host-events.md#steering).

## Certified integrations

The built-in adapter pack is pinned in
[`agent-adapters.lock.json`](agent-adapters.lock.json):

| Agent | Local transport | Distribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | ACP v1 | Pinned official Codex ACP npm adapter |
| Claude Code | ACP v1 | Pinned official Claude Agent ACP npm adapter |
| Cursor | ACP v1 | Native `cursor-agent acp` |
| OpenCode | ACP v1 | Native `opencode acp` |

Setup commands drain stdout and stderr concurrently. Version discovery has a
30-second deadline and a 1 MiB limit per output stream; npm installation has a
five-minute deadline and a 4 MiB limit per stream. Exceeding either limit fails
the operation and stops its process group on Unix or job on Windows. Remaining
descendants are also stopped when the parent exits successfully. These are
setup cleanup boundaries, not filesystem or network isolation. Failed adapter
downloads do not activate the staged cache, and setup can be retried.

Background installation shares readiness state with the serving host. Each
adapter failure triggers rediscovery, including an unwritable or malformed
cache directory, so a failed download does not remain labelled installing.
Graceful host shutdown cancels pending installs, stops their subprocess trees,
and joins the installer workers before exiting.

The release lock records exact npm adapter versions and their registry SRI
digests. The current bootstrap uses npm's own integrity verification for those
exact packages; a fully offline, Lemma-signed adapter pack remains a GA release
gate. Local upstream versions are probed and minimum supported versions are
enforced. Models and other session configuration are discovered from ACP at
runtime, so a newly available model does not require a Lemma backend release.

Headless services also search the standard Homebrew, local-bin, Volta, asdf,
mise, pnpm, Bun, Cargo, and installed NVM Node locations. Set
`LEMMA_AGENT_HOST_PATH` to an OS path list when an agent or adapter is installed
somewhere else.

## Security properties

- Every Lemma target pairing issues an independent opaque host secret,
  rotatable by re-pairing and revocable per host from the web UI or the host
  itself. The server stores only the SHA-256 hash, so a database leak exposes
  no usable credentials; locally the secret lives only in the owner-only
  `config.json` (mode 0600 on Unix).
- Pairing uses a short-lived, single-use code; the issued secret is returned
  exactly once at enrollment, and all device traffic is scoped to the one
  Agent Host link, which authenticates the secret once per connection.
- Target URLs require HTTPS. Plain HTTP is accepted only for an explicitly
  opted-in loopback development target.
- Provider OAuth/API credentials remain inside the provider's own local
  credential store.
- Lemma MCP credentials are encrypted at rest and scoped to one run and lease
  epoch. The adapter-private MCP bridge never holds one: it reaches the host's
  loopback relay with a random per-host token kept in an owner-only file, and
  the relay reads the run's current credential from the journal for each call.
- Agent Host does not advertise ACP client-side filesystem or terminal
  capabilities, permission requests fail closed, and known unrestricted or
  pre-approved provider modes are filtered and rejected again at dispatch.
- ACP sessions open and resume in the conversation's persistent directory. A cancellation is
  first an ACP `session/cancel`, so the agent ends its own turn and the provider
  flushes the session file the next turn resumes from; a process-tree kill is
  the backstop for an adapter that ignores it, and for shutdown. ACP is not an
  operating system sandbox; deployments needing stronger isolation should run
  Agent Host under a dedicated OS account or sandbox policy.
- Logs contain redacted operational metadata, never host secrets, run-scoped
  bearer tokens, or MCP authorization values.

See the design document for trust boundaries, replay defenses, SSRF controls,
credential rotation, and incident response.

## Build

The crate requires Rust 1.88 or newer.

```bash
cargo build --release --locked
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets
```

The release binary is `target/release/lemma-agent-host`. Lemma's macOS and
Windows Desktop builds compile and bundle the target-triple sidecar
automatically.

## Connect a target

Lemma Desktop owns this. **Models → Connect this computer** mints a pairing code
through the session the app already holds and hands it to the bundled sidecar
over locald's private IPC — nothing is displayed and nothing is copied.

The binary's own CLI is what Desktop and locald drive, and it is available for
development and debugging:

```bash
lemma-agent-host connect \
  --url https://api.example.lemma.ai \
  --pairing-code 'one-time-code'
```

One process can connect to multiple local, self-hosted, or Lemma Cloud targets.
Each connection has an independent secret, journal state, and revocation
boundary.

## Lifecycle and diagnostics

Desktop routes every lifecycle change through locald's authenticated private
IPC, and locald refuses a competing standalone service while it owns the
lifecycle. Against a host locald is not supervising, the binary answers directly:

```bash
lemma-agent-host discover
lemma-agent-host doctor
lemma-agent-host status
lemma-agent-host refresh
lemma-agent-host drain
lemma-agent-host resume
lemma-agent-host logs --follow
```

There is no OS service install any more. `install-service` built a launchd
LaunchAgent, a systemd user unit, or a per-user Task Scheduler entry pinned to a
downloaded release — a second install channel that could run alongside Desktop's
own copy against the same pairing, speaking an older protocol. Desktop is the
supported way to keep a host running; `lemma-agent-host serve` runs one in the
foreground for containers or an external supervisor.

A machine that ran `install-service` before still has that service. `status`
reports it, and `uninstall-service` removes it:

```bash
lemma-agent-host status --json   # "service": { "installed": true, ... }
lemma-agent-host uninstall-service
```

Disconnect revokes the remote device before deleting its local identity:

```bash
lemma-agent-host disconnect --target my-workspace
```

If a target is permanently unreachable, `--force-local` removes only the local
state. The remote device must then be revoked from Lemma separately.

## What each agent loads

Each run starts its agent with the agent's own instructions, skills, plugins,
hooks and MCP servers left out, where the agent has a switch for that, so that
what it is told and can use is Lemma's (`src/acp/session_options.rs`;
`docs/architecture/agent-host.md`, "What a coding agent loads", has the table).
Per agent, the person can put their own back:

```bash
lemma-agent-host own-settings enable claude-code    # load ~/.claude as in a terminal
lemma-agent-host own-settings disable claude-code   # Lemma's only (the default)
```

The setting is `own_settings` in `config.json`, read by each run as it starts.

## Host execution

On macOS the host can also run the paired user's Lemma agent commands on this
computer, inside a Seatbelt sandbox, instead of in the VM -- for the pairing
with the Lemma installed on this computer only (plain HTTP to loopback), never
for a hosted workspace or anybody else's install. It is off until the user
turns it on (Settings, or the CLI, which acts on that local pairing):

```bash
lemma-agent-host host-execution enable        # needs macOS and /usr/bin/sandbox-exec
lemma-agent-host host-execution status --json
lemma-agent-host host-execution refresh-environment   # after changing ~/.zshrc etc.
lemma-agent-host host-execution disable       # also stops everything running
```

The setting is `host_execution` on the local pairing's target in
`config.json` (an older host-wide `host_execution` is moved there when the
config is read); a running host re-reads it
within five seconds and reports it on its next `control` frame. Lemma sends
`op` frames on the link; the host starts one **exec-server** per open workspace
-- this same binary, `lemma-agent-host exec-server`, under
`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` with the profile in `resources/host-sandbox.sb`
(compiled into the binary) -- and relays each op to it over stdio. The
exec-server's environment is the owner's login shell's (`$SHELL -lic`, cached in
`host-environment.json` in the data directory) with credentials removed, and
with the `bin/` of the `lemma` CLI Lemma named in `workspace.open` first on
`PATH` when the host accepts that folder. See
`docs/architecture/desktop-host-execution.md` for the ops, the path policy and
the profile.

**Debugging an exec-server by hand.** It speaks one JSON object per line on
stdin and answers one per line on stdout, in whatever order ops finish; logs go
to stderr. Run it unconfined:

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"id":"1","workspace":"w","method":"workspace.open","params":{"slug":"debug"}}' \
  '{"id":"2","workspace":"w","method":"process.start","params":{"shell_command":"echo hi"}}' \
  | lemma-agent-host exec-server --root-base /tmp/lemma-debug
```

or confined exactly as the host runs it, which is how to find out whether a
tool fails because of the profile (`Operation not permitted` is Seatbelt):

```bash
sandbox-exec -p "$(cat desktop/agent-host/resources/host-sandbox.sb)" \
  -D ROOT=/private/tmp/lemma-debug -D HOME="$HOME" \
  -D TMP="$(cd "$TMPDIR" && pwd -P)" \
  /bin/bash -c 'cd /private/tmp/lemma-debug && gh auth status'
```

`log stream --predicate 'sender == "Sandbox"'` shows each denial as it
happens. Setuid programs (`ps`, `sudo`) cannot run under any sandbox profile.

## Direct adapter smoke tests

The `run` subcommand exercises the real ACP adapter and provider authentication
without connecting to Lemma or injecting tools:

```bash
lemma-agent-host run --agent codex --prompt 'Reply exactly: CODEX_OK'
lemma-agent-host run --agent claude-code --prompt 'Reply exactly: CLAUDE_OK'
lemma-agent-host run --agent opencode --prompt 'Reply exactly: OPENCODE_OK'
```

Pass `--json` for NDJSON containing the negotiated session, every ACP stream
event (including non-text content blocks), and the terminal outcome. This keeps
agent thoughts separate from assistant-message chunks and is the preferred
format for repeatable diagnostics.

This mode is intended for release qualification and local diagnosis. It creates
an isolated scratch directory under the Agent Host data directory.

## Durable local state

New conversations use the cwd saved by the backend at conversation creation.
Agent Host maps `/workspace/c/<date>/<slug>` to `~/lemma/c/<date>/<slug>` and
passes that absolute directory to both ACP `session/new` and `session/load`,
for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and other ACP harnesses. The native path and
provider session ID are reported before the prompt is dispatched and stored in
conversation metadata. Parent conversations and their children share the saved
cwd. Lemma MCP sandbox tools still use `/workspace`; this mapping does not mount
or synchronize the two filesystems.

Existing conversations with an old scratch directory keep it across upgrades,
preserving files and provider session indexes. Older backends that omit
`workspace_cwd` retain that compatibility layout. A path outside `/workspace`,
traversal, symlink components, unclaimed existing files, or a directory already
claimed by another paired workspace fails with an actionable run error.
The ownership registry under `~/lemma/.lemma` prevents accidental directory
collisions; it is not an OS sandbox or a project trust grant. For isolated QA,
set `LEMMA_AGENT_HOST_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to an absolute temporary directory before
starting Agent Host; production uses `~/lemma`.

Default data locations:

| Platform | Location |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Lemma/agent-host` |
| Linux | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/lemma/agent-host` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lemma\agent-host` |

`config.json` contains target metadata and the per-target host secret (the
file is owner-only). `mcp-relay/<target>.json` holds the loopback port and token
the MCP bridge uses to reach the host, also owner-only. `journal.sqlite3` contains durable commands, run states,
and the event outbox; run-scoped MCP configurations are journaled with their
runs until the backend acknowledges delivery. Set
`LEMMA_AGENT_HOST_DATA_DIR` only for development or isolated test runs.

## Testing

The crate has:

- unit tests for manifest pinning, version gates, configuration, lease
  heartbeats, journal replay, stream upsert synthesis, the link and its
  close codes, the per-adapter normalizers, and service definitions;
- golden-transcript tests replaying real recorded adapter sessions through the
  normalizers (`tests/normalize_golden.rs`; see "Golden transcripts" in
  `docs/architecture/agent-host-events.md`);
- a fake-process ACP end-to-end test using the official Rust ACP SDK;
- exec-server tests for every host-execution op, the output ring, chunked
  uploads, the path policy and environment scrubbing, and link tests that
  drive `op` frames through a relay (`src/host_exec/tests.rs`,
  `src/link/tests.rs`);
- on macOS, `tests/seatbelt.rs`, which runs real processes under the Seatbelt
  profile and proves its denials and allowances;
- a loopback link end-to-end test covering pairing, pushed commands, harness
  publication, event replay, reconnects, and self-revocation;
- backend PostgreSQL migration and full protocol tests; and
- a real backend/worker/Rust-host test over the link, with a scripted ACP provider,
  proving live conversation streaming, second turns, persistence after a
  client disconnect or provider crash, and concurrent tool approvals;
- Desktop/locald supervision tests that verify restart and full process-tree
  cleanup; and
- a control-plane contract test that pins the properties the stand-in backend in
  `tests/support` has to share with the real one.

The Rust end-to-end tests drive the shipped
host binary against that stand-in, which proves something about the host only
while the stand-in behaves like the backend. It did not: `agent_host_harnesses`
is unique on `(host_id, harness_key)` so a harness keeps one id for the life of
a host, and the double minted a fresh UUID on every publish. A re-publish then
named an id the host had not been told about yet, `START_RUN` was refused as
`HARNESS_NOT_FOUND` — permanent, and the double sends it once — and the test sat
out its full 90-second timeout. It surfaced as an intermittent hang across four
different tests in two files, on branches touching none of them.

**These tests are hermetic, and that is enforced rather than assumed.** The host
warms its adapter cache on `serve`, which means a real `npm install` of the
Codex and Claude Agent adapters and then a real probe of whichever finishes —
launching the developer's own agents inside a suite whose real-agent tests are
deliberately `#[ignore]`d. `HostProcess` sets
`LEMMA_AGENT_HOST_SKIP_ADAPTER_DOWNLOAD=1` to stop it. Set that variable
yourself only for a test run; a normal install needs its adapters.

The ignored real-harness test runs the same ACP driver against authenticated
Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode installations, then pairs a complete
`HostRuntime` with an isolated loopback control plane for every selected agent.
It checks that assistant text arrives before completion, the final answer is
complete, and the event sequence has one terminal event with no gaps or duplicates.
Follow-up tests exercise session continuity, missing sessions, cancellation,
native-tool approval and denial, and Lemma MCP tools. Use a disposable Agent Host
data directory containing copies of the verified adapters:

```bash
LEMMA_REAL_AGENT_HOST_DATA_DIR=/path/to/agent-host-data \
  cargo test --test real_harness_e2e -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

Set `LEMMA_REAL_AGENT_E2E_AGENTS=codex,opencode` to select a subset. These tests
are release qualification, not public CI: they require dedicated provider test
accounts and spend real quota. The paired fixture exercises the real Rust host;
the backend's link integration tests separately exercise its control-plane implementation.

Run `make desktop-agent-host-e2e` from the repository root to join those halves:
it builds the Rust host and pairs it with the real backend and worker. PostgreSQL,
Redis, and authentication services run in disposable test containers. The public
conversation SSE client must receive Unicode text before the scripted provider
is allowed to finish; subsequent turns and saved messages must preserve it.
Another case closes the client midstream and checks that the answer still
finishes and persists without repeating provider dispatch. This lane needs Rust,
backend dependencies, and Docker on macOS or Linux, with no provider credentials.
It runs in the required Desktop contracts CI job. Native Windows provider and
packaged-app qualification remain separate.

`make desktop-agent-host-browser-e2e` adds the real web chat, in lemma-frontend
(the workspace Desktop serves, started with `server.mjs --dev`): sending a message,
reading the approval card, approving or denying the native tool, live Unicode
streaming, Stop, simultaneous approvals with different decisions, a provider
crash, closing/reopening a streaming chat, and reloading
the resulting transcript. Install the locked dependencies in `lemma-typescript`,
`lemma-frontend`, and `desktop/ui-tests`, then install Playwright Chromium with
`npm exec --prefix desktop/ui-tests -- playwright install chromium`. Alternatively,
set `LEMMA_TEST_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` to use installed Chrome. The test creates
its own account, host, frontend server and browser profile; process groups and
containers are cleaned on failure too. Screenshots and frontend diagnostics go
under `output/playwright/`. This also runs in Desktop contracts CI.

### JSON ACP scenarios

The provider's wire messages live in `tests/fixtures/scenarios/*.json` and run
through `scripted_acp_agent.py <traffic-log> json:<scenario-path>`. They are
synthetic ACP v1 exchanges, consumed by the same ACP SDK as installed providers.
They do not replace backend endpoints or the chat UI with mocks. The streaming
fixtures are also shared with the Rust process-level regressions.

A version-1 scenario has `steps`, an optional `stopReason`, and an optional
`steering: true` that makes the agent advertise `_session/steering` in
`initialize` the way the pinned Claude Code and Codex adapters do. Each step has
one action:

- `send`: an actual ACP JSON-RPC notification or permission request.
- `await_permission`: wait for a response by request `id`, then replay the
  `selected[optionId]` or `cancelled` steps. Unknown responses fail the test.
- `await_cancel`: require the host's `session/cancel` notification.
- `await_steer`: wait for a `_session/steering` request and answer it with the
  step's `outcome` (`injected` by default, or `startedNewTurn`); an injected
  steer is echoed as agent text after the step's `echo` prefix.
- `await_release`: wait until the test client has observed live output and
  creates the traffic log's sibling `.release` file.
- `exit`: simulate a provider process failure with the given exit code.

The parallel fixture sends both requests before either is answered. The link
test answers the second first and makes different decisions, then checks exact
ACP responses, complete arguments, and one saved result per tool. Waiting for
approval uses a connection-owned task so later notifications and requests can
continue. Add only synthetic or fully sanitized provider exchanges to this
directory; keep the live-provider lane to detect adapter/protocol drift.

The supervisor owns worker, probe, delivery, and run tasks: cancellation or an
error cancels their work instead of detaching it. A closed installation-change
channel stops the worker, and refresh requests share one active discovery round.
The worker regressions cover these paths without launching installed providers.

The shared chat SDK treats `STOP_REQUESTED` as an active run until it settles.
Reopening a stopping conversation reattaches its stream, and requesting Stop
retains partial text while the final transcript is persisted.

`streaming_flow_e2e` runs without provider accounts. Its ACP subprocess waits for
the receiver to observe live Unicode text before finishing. It also tests a lost
append acknowledgement, preservation of partial text after an agent crash,
deadline, or host restart, and durable transcript snapshots that match the live
answer. Restart recovery seals acknowledged chunks from the journal before
recording the interrupted outcome; it never repeats an already dispatched prompt.

Codex native image generation has a separate opt-in smoke test because it spends
image-generation quota. It verifies that `$imagegen` produces a real PNG in the
explicit Agent Host artifact handoff directory:

```bash
LEMMA_REAL_AGENT_HOST_DATA_DIR=/path/to/agent-host-data \
LEMMA_REAL_AGENT_E2E_IMAGE=1 \
  cargo test --test real_harness_e2e \
  codex_native_image_generation_creates_a_publishable_artifact \
  -- --ignored --nocapture
```

//! `OpenCode`, through its native `opencode acp`.
//!
//! `OpenCode`'s tool name is the `title` of the call's *first* report
//! (`bash`, `read`, `edit`, `todowrite`...). Every later update replaces the
//! title with a description of the call -- the command, or the file it
//! touched -- so the name has to be kept from the opening. MCP tools are named
//! by joining server and tool with `_` (`lemma_tools_lemma_exec_command`),
//! which cannot be split for a server this host does not know; only Lemma's
//! own are recognised, and anyone else's is reported under `OpenCode`'s joined
//! name. Results carry the tool's text in `rawOutput.output` and, for a
//! command, the exit status in `rawOutput.metadata.exit`. All of this is read
//! off the transcripts in `tests/fixtures/acp/opencode@*`.

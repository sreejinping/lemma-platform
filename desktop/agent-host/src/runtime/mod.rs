/// for the next fifteen minutes — during which every command was rejected for

/// Was 60s, when probing every adapter ran in sequence behind four five-second

/// Doubling from here, capped at the ordinary refresh, because the two failures
/// this covers want opposite things. A probe that lost a race with the adapter
/// install wants to be retried almost immediately; a machine that is simply
/// slow, and will lose that race repeatedly, must not be re-probed every ten
/// seconds forever. Backing off reaches the same ceiling the sweep already had,

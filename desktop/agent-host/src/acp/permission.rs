///
/// It exists because of what the real adapters send. Claude Code's ACP adapter
/// routes every MCP tool through the default arm of `toolInfoFromToolUse`,
/// which returns `{ title: name, kind: "other" }` -- the raw namespaced tool
/// name, in the title field. It emits no `toolCall.toolName`, no
/// `toolCall.name`, and sets `_meta.claudeCode.toolName` only when the call
/// carries a `parentToolUseId`, i.e. only inside a sub-agent. So for an ordinary
/// top-level `mcp__lemma_tools__lemma_read_table` the title is the only field
/// carrying the identity, and ignoring it made every Lemma tool call raise an
/// approval card -- which is not a permission system, it is a way to train
/// people to click through one.
///
/// 1. **The kind is `other`.** This is the discriminator that makes the rest
///    safe, and the model does not choose it: the adapter derives `kind` from
///    which tool was called. `Bash` is `execute`, `Read` is `read`, `Task` is
///    `think`; only an MCP or unknown tool is `other`. So a shell command
///    cannot reach this path however it is titled -- which matters most for an
///    adapter that titles a command with its *description* rather than the
///    command itself.
/// 2. **The title carries our namespace.** A bare `lemma_read_table` is a claim
///    anyone can make; `mcp__lemma_tools__lemma_read_table` is the form an
///    adapter produces from a real registration.
/// 3. **The bare name is one this run published.** Exact, against `tool_names`

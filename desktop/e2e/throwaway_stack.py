"""Stand up a throwaway Lemma stack from this checkout, and take it down again.

The point is to run the desktop journeys against **the code in your working
tree** without touching the install you use. Two bugs shipped to users because
every automated check ran against something that was not the desktop build; this
is the lane where a change can be seen working before it becomes a DMG.

What it is faithful about, and what it borrows:

* The environment is rendered by **this checkout's `lemma-locald`**, not written
  out here. `Daemon::new` renders `host-pack.json` before it starts anything, so
  the daemon is run just long enough to produce one and then stopped. That
  matters: `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is the fix, and a harness that restated it
  would pass whether or not locald actually emits it.
* The backend is the **packed** interpreter and layout a release ships, with
  this checkout's `app/` overlaid onto it — so a change is exercised in the
  shape it will actually run in, not under `uv run`.
* Postgres, Redis and SuperTokens are **borrowed** from the running install's
  guest VM, on their own databases. A second VM would need ~4 GiB and a second
  set of container images for infrastructure this cannot affect: the throwaway
  databases are dropped on teardown, and the install's own are never opened.

So: separate root, separate ports, separate databases, separate storage. Shared
guest.

    python3 desktop/e2e/throwaway_stack.py up     # prints JSON on stdout
    python3 desktop/e2e/throwaway_stack.py down

`up` is idempotent-ish only in the sense that it refuses to run over a root that
is already up; run `down` first.

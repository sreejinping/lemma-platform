// Declaring an app manifest turns Tauri's ACL on for this app's own commands,
// not just plugin commands. Every command below must then be granted to a
// specific webview by a capability in `capabilities/`, and anything not granted
// is rejected - including from the bundled pages. That is the point: the
// workspace runs on a remote origin (the locald-served app URL, or the hosted
// site), and a remote origin can only reach a command through a capability that
// names its URL. Without a manifest there are no `allow-*` permissions to name,
// so the workspace cannot be granted anything at all.

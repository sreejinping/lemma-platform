"""The Makefile and desktop.ps1 offer the same verbs, or say why not.

`desktop.ps1` opens by claiming that "the same verbs live here, one per
`desktop-*` target ... Neither entrypoint reimplements the other, so they cannot
drift." They had: the Makefile carried twenty-two `desktop-*` targets and the
script eleven verbs, and four of the missing ones -- the file-size ratchet, the
baked-concepts check, the browser journeys, and `check` itself -- are not
platform-specific at all. A Windows contributor could not run the gate that
decides whether their change is acceptable.

Platform-specific targets are real and stay: a DMG is macOS, a guest image is
Linux, and cross-compiling the Windows paths only means something from a Mac.
Each is recorded below with the reason, so the difference is a decision rather
than an omission -- and a new target is a failure here until somebody says
which it is.

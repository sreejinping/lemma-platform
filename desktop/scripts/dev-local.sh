# window. `--control` brings it back for when Local settings *is* the thing
# being worked on.
#
# `--source` is the one to use while developing: locald supervises the backend
# out of lemma-backend/ through `uv run` and lemma-frontend through its own
# `server.mjs --dev` (Next in development mode, voice gateways included), so
# the workspace you get is the code you are editing rather than whatever the
# last release shipped. Everything else -- the managed runtime, ports, health
# checks, restart policy -- is identical to the packaged path, because a dev run
# that exercises a different supervisor proves nothing about the real one.
#
# The packaged app keeps its state in ~/Library/Application Support/Lemma. This
# script points every path at a throwaway root instead, so a dev session never
# adopts - or corrupts - the daemon, runtime, or Agent Host identity a real
# install owns.

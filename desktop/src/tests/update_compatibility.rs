/// `compatibility_with` was tested with a literal `Some(18)` for the installed

/// `dataCompatibility` -- found one read and zero writes, and every assertion
/// above still passed. Derived from the installed runtime's own manifest here,
/// which is the same field of the same file the release feed derives its number
/// from, so the two sides cannot drift apart.

//! are in the workspace's own Settings now, under "This Mac", so the commands
//! below are granted to the workspace origin.
//!
//! That origin is remote to Tauri, and the capability that names it also names
//! the hosted site. So every command here asks one narrower question than the
//! Agent Host commands do: is the caller this installation's own workspace, on
//! the loopback origin this app navigated to? Not the hosted site, which has no
//! installation here to change, and not a shared LAN or tunnel origin, which is
//! the same workspace republished for other people's devices.

//! Local settings answers the same commands from its bundled page while the

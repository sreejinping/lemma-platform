//! Anonymous install health for Lemma Desktop.
//!
//! Desktop is the primary distribution channel, and without this the first
//! signal that a runtime install broke on a new OS release is a GitHub issue
//! three weeks later. So this reports whether the install worked — and nothing
//! else.
//!
//! It is deliberately *not* the product-analytics catalog with fields left out.
//! It is a separate contract, with a separate ingestion key, that structurally
//! cannot express a pod, an organization, a user, or the name of anything the
//! person made. In Local mode the whole backend runs on their machine and the
//! README promises exactly that; the only thing that leaves is whether the
//! software started.
//!
//! Off by every switch that should turn it off: `LEMMA_TELEMETRY=0`, the Local
//! settings toggle (persisted here), and — the default — no ingestion key
//! compiled in, which is the case for every locally built binary.

# Lemma Desktop maintainer guide

Lemma Desktop is a thin Tauri shell over the durable `lemma-locald` control
plane. It supports hosted Lemma and a zero-toolchain local installation.

For the user journey, see [Install and run Lemma locally](../docs/installation.md).
For the process topology, lifecycle protocol, and port model, see the
[Desktop architecture](../docs/architecture/desktop.md).

## Shipped topology

The host runs:

- `lemma-desktop`;
- `lemma-locald`;
- one all-in-one Python backend;
- one Next.js frontend;
- `lemma-runtime` plus `lemma-vz` on macOS or WSL tooling on Windows.

The private guest runs PostgreSQL, Redis, SuperTokens, containerd, and the sandbox runtime
sandboxes. There is no user-facing Docker/Podman dependency and no Kreuzberg
container. PDF/document conversion runs in the backend.

Closing every window hides Desktop to the tray. The daemon and desired services
survive shell exit so schedules continue. **Quit Lemma** (⌘Q) performs a full
stop before exit, after naming what is running — closing the window is the way
to leave without stopping anything, so quitting does not need to be the other
one too.

Every exit route funnels through `RunEvent::ExitRequested`, including Dock →
Quit and the app's own `exit` after a confirmed stop. `Shell::quit_confirmed` is
what keeps that from re-arming the prompt against the exit it just authorised.

Because the stack outlives the shell, a relaunch is usually a reconcile rather
than a start. Desktop records the serving workspace and its runtime generation,
and a launch whose recorded workspace answers with that same generation opens it
directly — no splash, no navigation — and reconciles with the daemon on a
worker. Anything else falls back to the splash.

## Runtime packaging

Public release apps bundle only `lemma-local.json` and native control helpers.
The online application payload has a shared 40 MiB budget, enforced by
`desktop/scripts/check_online_payload.py` across CI, stable and nightly builds.
The check includes Agent Host and every configured Windows sidecar/resource;
on macOS it measures the complete app bundle. First launch
downloads:

- `lemma-host-pack-<target>.zip`;
- `lemma-guest-runtime-<target>.zip`.

Every manifest entry contains source URL/resource, SHA-256, compressed size,
expanded size, archive format, platform target, and release identity. Archives
are resumable, verified while transferring, extracted into disposable staging,
validated, and atomically activated.

Candidates are staged beside existing releases before local services stop.
Artifact digests distinguish builds that share a version number. Repair forces
a fresh verified extraction without moving or deleting the prior tree; it also
works when cached runtime marker files are missing. Staging never prunes older
releases. Retention keeps the running release and one previous
(`installedRuntime`, `previousRuntime`): activation prunes the rest, and the
app prunes again after the first `ready` of each launch, when nothing can still
be using a retired one (a removal that failed at activation, which Windows does
for a release in use, used to stay for ever). Installed-app upgrade
qualification is separate from archive verification.

The PR test DMG embeds the two compressed archives and rewrites only their
manifest sources to trusted resource names. It must not contain expanded
`local-runtime` or `managed-runtime` directories.

Current hard gates:

- host plus guest compressed: 6 GiB;
- PR bundled application: 7 GiB;
- expanded immutable runtime: 8 GiB;
- macOS root disk before shrinking: 2 GiB;
- public application payload: 40 MiB.

OCI infrastructure/sandbox images are not included. Public offline claims and
offline release artifacts are intentionally removed.

## Build and test locally

The settings tests run the shipped HTML and JavaScript with mocked desktop
IPC in a disposable Chromium profile. `make desktop-test-browser` installs its
pinned test dependencies and browser. To use an installed Chrome for the same
tests, run `LEMMA_TEST_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome make desktop-test-browser`.
These tests do not access the installed Lemma application or its data, and do
not replace packaged macOS/Windows installation and upgrade qualification.

Prerequisites for maintainers are Rust, the Node.js version in `.nvmrc`, Swift/Xcode on macOS,
Python/uv, and the repository’s normal build toolchain.

### Before you push

One command runs every desktop gate CI has, cheapest first:

```bash
make desktop-check
```

It is `desktop-fmt`, `desktop-concepts-check`, `desktop-lint`, `desktop-test`,
`desktop-check-windows`, and `desktop-test-browser`. Run it rather than the
individual targets. It is
not a promise that CI will be green — bundling, codesigning, and the app crate's
Windows paths have no local equivalent (see below) — but everything it does
cover fails here in seconds instead of there in minutes. The
pieces have always existed and nothing ran them together, so "I ran the desktop
checks" meant whichever two you remembered — and the two most often forgotten
are the two that fail slowest in CI:

| Local step | CI job it stands in for | What only it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make desktop-fmt` | Desktop workspace → Check formatting | `cargo fmt` is **not** part of `desktop-lint`; clippy will not tell you |
| `make desktop-concepts-check` | Desktop workspace → Verify baked splash concepts | `ui/concepts.gen.json` regenerated but not committed |
| `make desktop-lint` | Desktop workspace → Lint | clippy `-D warnings` across the workspace |
| `make desktop-test` | Desktop workspace → Test, and Desktop contracts | the whole workspace, `--locked` |
| `make desktop-check-windows` | Windows desktop build check, **in part** | the `cfg(windows)` paths in locald and the runtime manager — no other local step compiles them |

The Windows one is worth the 15 seconds every time you touch `locald` or the
runtime manager. Nothing else on a Mac compiles those `cfg` branches, and the
job that does takes 90 minutes to tell you. A `#[cfg(unix)]` helper called from
a function that is not gated compiles perfectly here and fails there.

Faster loops, once you know what you are changing:

```bash
make desktop-test-app      # just the app crate
make desktop-fmt-fix       # rewrite instead of check
swift build --package-path desktop/local-runtime/macos-vz
uv run --project lemma-backend pytest \
  lemma-backend/app/tests/unit/test_health_endpoints.py
npm --prefix lemma-frontend run typecheck
```

**What `make desktop-check` cannot cover.** Bundling and codesigning need
release certificates, so the DMG and NSIS steps of those CI jobs have no local
equivalent — `make desktop-dmg` is the approximation. The **Guest daemon
(Linux)** job is also only partly covered: `desktop-test` builds and tests
`lemma-guestd` on macOS, but its vsock listener sits behind a Linux `cfg` that
only a Linux build compiles, which is what `make desktop-guestd` does there.

`lemma-guestd` is the Linux guest daemon: it reaches for `std::os::unix`
unconditionally, so it builds and tests on macOS and Linux but not on Windows.
Its vsock listener is behind a Linux `cfg` that only a Linux build compiles,
which is why CI runs `make desktop-guestd` there as well.

The `cfg(windows)` branches are most of the runtime manager, locald's job
objects and named pipes, and the Agent Host's npm shims.

`make desktop-check-windows` covers locald and the runtime manager, using the
msvc target directly — those two crates pull no C toolchain, so it needs
nothing installed but the target and takes about fifteen seconds. That is the
one to run habitually, and it is already part of `make desktop-check`.

The **app crate** is the part that cannot be cross-compiled to msvc from macOS:
`libsqlite3-sys` needs a C toolchain. The gnu target compiles the same `cfg`
branches, so when you have changed the app crate's Windows paths, lint the whole
workspace this way:

```bash
brew install mingw-w64
cd desktop
# tauri-build resolves externalBin by target triple, so the app crate needs
# files under the Windows names before it will compile at all. Placeholders
# are enough for a lint; only bundling reads them.
for n in lemma-locald lemma-agent-host lemma-runtime; do
  cp "binaries/$n-aarch64-apple-darwin" "binaries/$n-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe"
done
CC_x86_64_pc_windows_gnu=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_GNU_LINKER=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  cargo clippy --workspace --exclude lemma-guestd \
    --all-targets --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -- -D warnings
rm -f binaries/*windows-gnu.exe
```

The **Windows desktop build check** job in CI is the real gate for both; this is
how to avoid learning about it from a red PR ninety minutes later.

Build Desktop sidecars:

```bash
make desktop-sidecars
```

Native sidecars share Cargo's `target/release` dependency tree with the Tauri
build; cross builds retain their explicit target directory. CI, stable and
nightly native jobs share compiler/platform-keyed Rust dependency caches.
PR caches remain scoped to their merge ref, and failed desktop checks retain
dependencies for the next attempt. The npm cache includes both the Tauri pin
and the settings lockfile. Cached build output does not bypass tests, signing
or runtime verification.

The journal concurrency regression runs in a bounded child process, so a
SQLite lock regression fails without hanging the entire suite. It reproduces
the concurrent WAL open/close deadlock in bundled SQLite 3.51.1; the upgraded
dependency includes SQLite's upstream fix.

On Windows there is no `make`, so the same verbs live in a PowerShell
dispatcher over the same underlying scripts:

```powershell
pwsh desktop\scripts\desktop.ps1 help
pwsh desktop\scripts\desktop.ps1 test
pwsh desktop\scripts\desktop.ps1 exe
```

The source-development launcher currently supports macOS. Windows startup and
confirmed cleanup derive the same installation-specific WSL distribution name;
only the default installation retains the legacy name. Windows packaged-app
qualification must still use a disposable user/installation and verify that its
distribution and data are separate before exercising recovery.

### Reproducing a flake under CPU load

Desktop tests that gate on timing — `locald`'s health gates, the restart
circuit, the Agent Host's permission flow — behave differently on a loaded
machine, which is how CI sees them and how you usually cannot. To reproduce
that locally, use the script:

```bash
desktop/scripts/stress_test_under_load.sh "desktop_context native_material" 400 12 1800
```

Arguments are the cargo test filter, iterations, the number of CPU hogs
(default: cores minus one), and a hard runtime ceiling in seconds.

**Do not hand-roll this loop.** Spawning `yes > /dev/null &` or
`(while :; do :; done) &` in a shell command and killing the pids on the last
line is the single most expensive mistake available in this directory. The last
line does not run when the command times out, when the harness kills it, or
when the session ends — the hogs are reparented onto pid 1 and burn a core each
until somebody opens Activity Monitor. It has happened at least twice, most recently for
an hour and a half across nineteen orphaned processes on an 11-core laptop,
while every command that spawned them cheerfully printed `load stopped`.

The script exists because that failure is not obvious to get right: it traps
`EXIT INT TERM HUP` (bash's default `HUP` handler skips the `EXIT` trap, so
closing the terminal leaks everything), kills by array rather than by
whitespace-joined string, and runs a watchdog that signals the load directly so
the teardown does not depend on the parent still being alive. `docs/testing.md`
has the full rule, including why the obvious `kill $PIDS` silently no-ops in
`zsh`.

If you ever suspect a leak:

```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,pcpu,etime,comm | awk '$2 == 1 && $3 > 50'
```

### End-to-end: does an install actually serve a working app?

`make desktop-check` compiles and unit-tests. None of it opens an app. These
three lanes do, in rising order of what they need.

```bash
make desktop-e2e-temp     # this working tree, no build, ~35s
make desktop-e2e          # a packaged install you are running
make scenarios-desktop    # the whole journey suite against that install
```

**`desktop-e2e-temp` is the one to run while changing locald.** It builds locald
from the working tree, renders a host pack, borrows the running install's guest
Postgres and Redis, publishes an app and drives a real WKWebView against it —
top-level *and* embedded in a workspace frame. It needs the desktop app running
(for the guest), `swift`, and `psql`.

Two things it deliberately does not cover, both reported rather than hidden:

- **Functions.** It runs no locald, so nothing dispatches a function into a
  guest sandbox. That test skips, naming `make desktop-e2e` as the lane for it.
- **Framing on `lemma.localhost`.** The embedded test skips: WebKit treats
  every `*.localhost` host as its own site, so an app framed on its own address
  is third-party by construction. The macOS workspace frames a same-site alias
  from locald instead, and `make desktop-app-alias-proof` proves that in
  WKWebView (see `desktop/e2e/app_alias_proof/README.md`).

**`desktop-e2e` runs against whatever install is running** and *hard-fails*
rather than skipping when it cannot find one. That is on purpose — a lane that
skips when the thing it tests is absent reports success for doing nothing — but
it means the message, not the failure, is what tells you what is missing. No CI
job runs it: it needs a packaged install and a guest VM.

**`scenarios-desktop` is the widest coverage the desktop build has.** It points
the product journey suite — orgs, pods, tables, files, agents, functions,
workflows, schedules, bundles, app publishing — at the install, through the real
host pack and the real guest. The address comes from what locald rendered, so
there is nothing to configure.

It writes real data, and the product cannot delete an organization, so:

```bash
make scenarios-desktop-provision SCENARIOS_ALLOW_NEW_CAST=1   # once per install
```

The flag is not passed for you. On a fresh install it means "yes, first time";
on a shared deployment the same prompt means the cast already exists under other
addresses, and answering blindly builds a second parallel one out of
organizations nothing can remove. The run also pins
`SCENARIOS_TARGET_INSTANCE_ID` to the install's own id, so restarting the app
onto a different install mid-session stops the run instead of writing into it.

### Signing a local build you intend to actually use

The sidecar script signs with a Developer ID when the machine has one and falls
back to ad-hoc otherwise, saying which it chose. Set `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` to
override it — including to `-` to force ad-hoc, which is what CI does for builds
that are deliberately untrusted.

Export the same identity when bundling, because the bundler re-signs the
sidecars it copies in:

```bash
export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: NAME (TEAMID)"
```

Without it an otherwise Developer ID build ends up with an ad-hoc daemon, and
that has a user-visible cost rather than just a Gatekeeper one. locald keeps the
credential-file encryption key in the OS credential vault, which ties the item to
the code identity of whoever created it. An ad-hoc designated requirement is a
bare `cdhash`, so every rebuild is a new program as far as the vault is
concerned and the user is asked to re-authorise access on the next launch. A
Developer ID requirement names `work.lemma.locald` and the team instead — the
identifier being fixed by the `Info.plist` that `desktop/locald/build.rs` links into the
binary — and survives rebuilds.

Verify with:

```bash
codesign -d -r- desktop/binaries/lemma-locald-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

A `designated => cdhash H"..."` line means a rebuild changes the vault identity.
A Developer ID requirement must bind both `work.lemma.locald` and the expected
signing team. A stable identifier alone is insufficient. The signed upgrade
qualification must verify access to an existing credential file without new
prompts; a locked keychain or changed identity can still require authorization.

All four macOS helpers embed fixed identifiers: `work.lemma.locald`,
`work.lemma.agent-host`, `work.lemma.runtime`, and `work.lemma.vz`. Backend,
frontend, and helper code may change without changing these identifiers or the
release signing team. Release verification rejects ad-hoc signatures, a wrong
team, and a missing or changed helper identity. To qualify an upgrade, retain
the previous signed app and check the actual candidate against its designated
requirements:

```bash
uv run --no-project python desktop/scripts/check_macos_signing.py candidate/Lemma.app \
  --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" --previous-app previous/Lemma.app
```

This checks code trust, not Keychain consent or database migration. Also launch
both builds against a disposable installation, store a test credential with the
first, and verify the second reads it without another prompt, preserves local
data, and reaches healthy services. Exercise locked, denied, and subsequently
unlocked Keychain states without deleting the encrypted credential file.

The signing tests build changed native binaries and evaluate their previous
requirements using macOS itself. They also read a previous binary's credential
from a disposable Keychain with consent dialogs disabled, and reject access
after changing the helper identity. They do not use the login Keychain.
The certificate-backed case is opt-in:

```bash
LEMMA_SIGNING_TEST_IDENTITY="$APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY" \
LEMMA_SIGNING_TEST_TEAM="$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  uv run --no-project python -m unittest discover -s desktop/scripts -p test_check_macos_signing.py
```

An explicitly selected Apple Development certificate and `--allow-development`
support local QA. They do not qualify a release. Changing an old ad-hoc build to
a certificate-backed build can still require one approval for the new identity.

The actual packaged daemon also has an opt-in native credential check. It uses
uniquely named test entries in the current OS credential store, checks creation,
replacement and removal, and starts a disposable daemon twice to verify encrypted
state and shutdown. It removes only those test entries and that test root. If
cleanup fails, the root is retained so its installation identity is recoverable.
The macOS stable and nightly workflows run this against their packaged daemon:

```bash
LEMMA_NATIVE_CREDENTIAL_TEST_BINARY="candidate/Lemma.app/Contents/MacOS/lemma-locald" \
LEMMA_SIGNING_TEST_TEAM="$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  uv run --no-project python -m unittest discover -s desktop/scripts -p test_native_credentials.py
```

For a locally signed development candidate, explicitly add
`LEMMA_NATIVE_CREDENTIAL_ALLOW_DEVELOPMENT=1`.

Credentials are encrypted in `locald/credentials.enc`; the OS vault retains its
encryption key. Existing per-secret vault entries migrate on first access and
remain available for recovery until explicit removal or full cleanup. Do not
delete that key or the encrypted file to resolve a startup problem. Missing keys
and failed decryption preserve the file and report an error.

To run Desktop local mode against the code you are editing:

```bash
desktop/scripts/dev-local.sh --source
```

locald supervises the backend out of `lemma-backend/` through `uv run` and
`lemma-frontend` through its own `server.mjs --dev` (Next in development mode,
voice gateways included), so the workspace is your working tree rather than
the last release. It runs straight from the checkout with no npm in between,
so run `npm ci` in `lemma-typescript` and `lemma-frontend` first; `make
desktop-dev` checks and builds the SDK if needed. Origins arrive in the
frontend's environment and reach the browser through `/site-config.js` —
see [frontend hosting](../docs/architecture/desktop.md#51-frontend-hosting-and-runtime-configuration).

To try the packaged frontend without building a whole pack:

```bash
cd lemma-frontend
LEMMA_STANDALONE=1 npm run build && node scripts/complete-standalone.mjs
cd .next/standalone/lemma-frontend
PORT=3100 NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8710 NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100 \
  NEXT_PUBLIC_LEMMA_DEPLOYMENT=local node server.mjs
``` The managed runtime, ports, health checks and restart policy
are the packaged ones — a dev run that exercised a different supervisor would
prove nothing about the real one.

It opens the workspace, as the packaged app does. Add `--control` when Local
settings is the thing you are working on.

It borrows the VM guest artifacts from an installed release (the one thing a
checkout cannot build on demand) read-only; override the location with
`LEMMA_DESKTOP_MANAGED_RUNTIME_ROOT`. To run a released pack instead, pass its
path:

```bash
desktop/scripts/dev-local.sh /absolute/path/to/local-runtime
```

Either way it rebuilds the native sidecars, gracefully replaces the prior
isolated dev daemon, and keeps its state under `/tmp/lemma-desktop-dev` so an
installed Lemma daemon cannot capture the dev UI — and so a dev session never
adopts or corrupts a real install's Agent Host identity.

For source-level installer testing, prepare an exact manifest and archives and
set:

```bash
export LEMMA_DESKTOP_RELEASE_MANIFEST=/absolute/path/lemma-local.json
export LEMMA_DESKTOP_ALLOW_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS=1
```

Only that explicitly selected manifest may use `file://` artifact sources.

These are **development-build overrides and a packaged release ignores them
entirely** — along with `LEMMA_DESKTOP_HOST_PACK_ROOT`,
`LEMMA_DESKTOP_MANAGED_RUNTIME_ROOT`, and the port overrides below. That is not
tidiness: the manifest carries the digests every downloaded artifact is verified
against, so honouring an override in a signed build would let anything already
running as the user choose both the runtime Lemma executes and the check on it.
`dev_override` in `desktop/src/main.rs` is the single gate, and a test asserts
none of those variables is read around it.

## Build a test installer

CI's **Desktop workspace** and **Windows desktop build check** jobs prove the
app compiles, lints, tests, and bundles. The macOS artifact is named
`lemma-desktop-macos-buildcheck-<sha>`. When Windows packaging runs, its unsigned
NSIS installer is retained for 14 days as `desktop-windows-x64-buildcheck`,
alongside a `candidate.json` recording the checked-out commit and installer
SHA-256. These builds use a placeholder runtime manifest with unresolvable
URLs. They support shell and installer checks, but cannot qualify Local Lemma
installation or upgrades; those require the complete runtime build below.

For a build someone else can install, cut a **Release Local Images** run with
`share`:

```bash
DESKTOP_VERSION=$(jq -r .version desktop/tauri.conf.json)
gh workflow run release-local-images.yml -f version="$DESKTOP_VERSION" -f publish=false -f share=true
```

That publishes the runtime archives and the manifest to a prerelease tagged
`desktop-nightly-<short-sha>-<run>-<attempt>`, then builds the **online** DMG against it —
signed with Developer ID, notarized and stapled — and attaches it there. The
download link is printed to the job summary. Prereleases never become "Latest",
so the version-tag release channel is untouched.

Both platforms use `<desktop-version>-nightly.<run>.<attempt>`, including a new
version for a rerun. Their Tauri updater artifacts are signed with the same
update key as stable builds. The Windows installer is also Authenticode signed
when the Windows certificate secrets are configured; otherwise it is explicitly
a test build without publisher signing and Windows may show SmartScreen warnings.
An absent publisher certificate never disables update signature verification.

After both builds succeed, one job publishes their immutable payloads and then
`desktop-nightly/latest.json`. An older finishing run cannot replace a newer
feed. Nightlies accept only newer nightlies; stable builds accept only newer
stable versions. Local development builds do not self-update. Runtime and app
assets are retained so an installed nightly is not stranded by automatic pruning.

To qualify the update path, install nightly A, create representative local data,
and publish nightly B with app/backend/frontend changes. Use Settings → This Mac →
Updates to install B, reopen, and verify the version, credentials, data, services,
and conversation continuity. Repeat with interrupted downloads and installation
failure. Run this on macOS and Windows; feed publication alone is not upgrade
qualification. A Windows update that would replace the guest runtime refuses to
run until the separate data-holder distribution confirms it has the data
(`refuse_replacement_without_holder`); the update itself is not hidden.

Nightlies are offered, never installed on their own: This Mac → Updates checks
the feed and installs only what the person agreed to. Each nightly is cut from
a main commit whose `CI passed` succeeded, re-checked by the build itself before
it publishes anything. A migration a nightly has carried is shipped: installed
nightlies ran it, so `lint-migration-order` refuses edits to it.

It has to be the online DMG. Apple's notary service unpacks `host-runtime.zip`
and rejects everything inside: a bundled CPython and `node_modules` are not
Developer ID signed and never will be. So a self-contained DMG cannot be
notarized, and an un-notarized one is refused by Gatekeeper on any machine that
did not build it. CI does not package self-contained apps at all — half a
gigabyte a run, for something nobody can hand to a tester.

Without `share`, a `publish: false` run still builds and verifies both
platforms' runtimes and uploads them as workflow artifacts, which is what the
local self-contained builds below consume.

### Or build one locally

The same run's artifacts also drive a local build, through the same staging
script CI uses — so a green local build and a green CI build mean the same
thing. The host pack and the guest runtime cannot be produced from a checkout
(the pack embeds digests of specific container builds; the guest is assembled
under `docker buildx` with a kernel unpacked by `zstd`), which is why this
fetches them:

```bash
make desktop-runtime-fetch RUN=<run-id>
make desktop-dmg
```

```powershell
pwsh desktop\scripts\desktop.ps1 runtime-fetch -Run <run-id>
pwsh desktop\scripts\desktop.ps1 exe
```

One run feeds both machines. The test app installs its embedded compressed
runtimes into Application Support on first launch; registry access is still
required for infrastructure and sandbox images.

### Qualifying on a machine that already runs Lemma

```bash
make desktop-dmg QA=1
```

The same DMG, built as a separate application: **Lemma Candidate QA**, bundle
identifier `work.lemma.candidate-qa`, and its own
`~/Library/Application Support/Lemma Candidate QA`.

That last part is the point, and it is not tidiness. locald keys its process
ledger, its runtime tree and its reset command on that directory, so a
candidate sharing it with the installation already on the machine would stop
the user's daemon, adopt its runtime, and erase its pods on cleanup. The
directory name is compiled in (`LEMMA_DESKTOP_DATA_DIR_NAME`), not passed at
launch, so it holds however the candidate is started -- including from the
Finder by somebody you handed it to.

A release build must not carry it. `a_release_build_keeps_its_data_where_installed_lemma_already_has_it`
fails if it does, because moving that directory orphans the data of every
installation that already exists.

Removing a candidate afterwards is its own application and its own directory:
quit it, delete `Lemma Candidate QA.app`, delete
`~/Library/Application Support/Lemma Candidate QA`. Nothing there is shared
with the real installation.

## Clean macOS acceptance test

Use a disposable test machine where possible. For an intentionally destructive
local reset, first **Quit Lemma**, remove the test app, then remove
`~/Library/Application Support/Lemma`. Never make a release repair delete that
directory.

Acceptance flow:

1. Copy the PR app from the DMG to Applications; confirm the copy is not multi-GB.
2. Launch from Applications and choose Local.
3. Confirm download/extraction stages show real progress and no Start button.
4. Create a local account inside WKWebView; verify it remains authenticated.
   Confirm the marketing landing page never appears — not before signup, not
   after signing out, and not in a LAN browser (step 11).
5. Confirm the workspace does not return to the installer after Ready.
6. Walk local onboarding: choose an installed coding agent, an API provider,
   or a local model server, then choose who can reach this installation. An
   API provider is optional when a coding agent is ready. Continuing without
   either must not claim that AI is ready. At the minimum window size and with
   enlarged text, confirm every step's Continue/Create action is fully visible
   without scrolling. Tab through the form: content may scroll, actions stay
   put.
7. Press ⌘, and use the tray's **Desktop settings…**: both open Settings at
   **This Mac** in the workspace, without remounting it. Stop the stack and
   press ⌘, again: Local settings opens instead, with Overview, Recovery and
   Diagnostics. Sign in to the app as a second account and confirm This Mac
   is still shown -- it follows the app's own window on the loopback origin,
   not the account. Open the same workspace in a browser, and from a LAN
   device while sharing, and confirm This Mac is not shown at all.
8. Configure AI from **Settings → This Mac → Server setup**, which replaces the
   Advanced credential list. It shows one card per capability -- AI model
   (required), Email, Connectors, Channels, Voice and Web search -- each with
   its status and a **Test** action. With no model configured, the AI model
   card must say so and nothing may claim that AI is ready; the optional cards
   report their own state without blocking anything. Add an API provider or a
   local model server, run **Test**, and confirm a chat replies and gets a
   title. Type a wrong key and confirm **Test** reports the rejection and
   **Save** refuses it. Save a Composio key and confirm its connectors appear
   without restarting Lemma; save a Telegram bot token and confirm the bot
   answers without a public link. Set up Email and confirm **Send a test
   email** arrives and an invitation is emailed. On a fresh install, confirm
   the first-run checklist appears right after signup and leads to the same
   cards.
9. With Ollama and LM Studio running, open **Settings → Models** and confirm
   each is offered as **Add as provider** with its models; add one and verify
   thinking and structured tool calls. If this install had an AI provider set
   before, confirm it is offered as **Add to workspace** and that titles still
   work after adding it.
10. From the onboarding agents step, and again from **Models**, confirm the
    computer pairs on its own. A failed start or pairing must display the
    failure and offer **Retry connection**, without remaining on a loading row.
    Add a detected agent with **Use in chat**, pick it in a chat, run a
    prompt, and approve a permission. Confirm the tray reads
    `Agent Host: connected`. Closing the window keeps it running; Quit stops it,
    and reopening restores the paired host. A machine with no coding agents
    installed must say so and still let the step continue. Repeat in hosted
    mode: the Agent Host connects without downloading the complete local stack.
11. From **Settings → This Mac → Sharing**, enable **Local network** on a trusted Wi-Fi interface. Scan the QR code in a
    second browser, create/sign into an account, and verify streamed chat, a
    tool call, and a file transfer. Confirm that browser is offered the account
    portal rather than the landing page. Disable it and confirm the LAN port
    closes.
12. Verify ngrok preflight without exposing credentials. Activate a public link
    only after the native confirmation (the page cannot skip it), repeat streamed chat/file/webhook
    checks, then disable it. After `cloudflared tunnel login`, verify automatic
    setup creates one installation-owned named tunnel and DNS route, reuses it
    after disable, and still offers an existing tunnel as an advanced option.
    Quick Tunnels must not appear.
13. Run a sandbox operation that uses `lemma` CLI against the dynamic API.
14. Open a built React app at `*.apps.lemma.localhost`; while sharing, verify
    the UI honestly says published pod apps remain local-only.
15. Check the menu bar: **Desktop settings…** on ⌘, opens This Mac settings (or Local settings when the workspace is not up), and no menu
    item names a service. The tray's first line must report the stack's real
    state, and everything operational must sit under **Troubleshoot**.
16. Close the window; verify schedules, the Agent Host, and active sharing
    remain available from the tray. Then press ⌘Q with sharing on, the Agent
    Host paired, and the stack up: the prompt must name all three, offer closing
    the window as the alternative, and say data stays on this Mac. Cancel, and
    confirm nothing stopped. Quit again and confirm it stops everything, shows
    responsive in-app shutdown progress rather than a black window, and that
    Dock → Quit is asked in the same way. With the stack stopped, no Agent Host
    and no shared link, ⌘Q must exit without asking anything.
    Repeat during startup and a blocked setup stage: Quit must be admitted,
    no later startup stage may launch after its cancellation checkpoint, and a
    migration must reach a known outcome before cleanup. Repeated ⌘Q must not
    force interruption; the slow-shutdown fallback must explain the recovery risk.
17. Restart and confirm ports and data persist, but LAN/Public mode does not
    resume automatically. Close one conversation to the tray, reopen, select a
    different conversation and Quit. Launch again: the second conversation and
    its durable transcript must reopen. Repeat with Settings over that page.
    When the existing services are still healthy, check **Diagnostics → Launch
    timing** for `resume: hit`. After a full Quit, show actual service startup
    progress before restoring the remembered page.
18. Inspect every Diagnostics source and exercise runtime repair.
19. Quit and confirm the VM also releases its memory — `ps` must show no
    `lemma-vz`, and Activity Monitor no multi-GB helper, once the app is gone.

Also test with blocked Hugging Face access, a failed OCI registry/DNS request,
and unrelated listeners occupying persisted ports.

### Recovery and update scenarios

Run these against disposable native installations as well as the Rust and
browser regressions. Never corrupt or reset an installation containing real
accounts, credentials, or project work. Passing fixture tests does not qualify
a shipped artifact.

19. **Incompatible data.** Install a build pinned to an older Postgres major,
    create a pod with data, then install one pinned to a newer major and press
    Start. The failure must arrive in **under ten seconds**, not after a
    two-minute timeout; `errorCode` must be `local-data-incompatible`; **Reset
    local data** must be offered and **Try again** must not be. After the reset,
    confirm no container images were re-pulled — the guest tidies itself
    precisely so they survive.
20. **A data disk that cannot be read.** With Lemma closed, overwrite the first
    megabyte of `locald/runtime/macos/data.raw`. Launch: the console must carry
    `lemma-data: needs-repair:`, the app must say so rather than waiting out its
    budget, and the reset must recover. Worth running once against a build from
    before this change, to see the old one destroy the disk silently.
21. **Reset with the stack up.** Press **Reset local data** while everything is
    running. `ps` must show no `lemma-vz` at the moment the disk is discarded,
    and the app must come back to a clean workspace.
22. **Start over from a wedged installation.** Truncate `locald/control.token`
    *and* corrupt `operator-config.json` in a disposable installation. Open
    **Recovery** from the welcome screen or tray. **Restart into Recovery**
    must pause services and downloads. **Force cleanup and reinstall** must
    open Lemma's in-app confirmation with Cancel focused. Enter, Escape, and
    closing the window must preserve all fixture data. After explicitly
    choosing **Erase Local Lemma**, the locald root, downloaded releases,
    Agent Host pairings and managed folders are gone; external project canaries
    and the runtime installation log survive, and the chooser returns. Test
    credential removal with a dedicated test identity only. A live endpoint or
    failed credential/VM cleanup must report failure and retain retry records.
23. **Start over with an orphaned VM.** `kill -9` the locald pid, leaving
    `lemma-vz` alive, then start over. The helper must be gone afterwards — it
    is reclaimed by verified identity, not by name.
24. **Session isolation.** Sign in, reset local data, sign up again. There must
    be no 401 refresh storm in `backend.log`: a cookie minted against the
    deleted database would otherwise be accepted as a session that can do
    nothing.
25. **Concurrency.** Press Start and Reset within the same second. One must be
    refused as busy, and the loser must touch nothing.
26. **Update.** Install v(N-1) from its DMG into Applications, complete first
    run, create a workspace. Publish v(N) and confirm This Mac → Updates offers it
    with the real runtime download size. Update (Lemma restarts itself once
    installed; there is no "Later"), and confirm the
    workspace returns with its data, that `pgrep -a lemma-locald` shows nothing
    from the previous bundle, and that the relaunched app does not bounce off
    its own single-instance lock. Repeat with Lemma in a non-writable location
    and confirm it says to download the DMG instead.
27. **Update in cloud mode.** On Lemma Cloud with an older installed build,
    wait about 20 seconds after launch: the tray and the Lemma menu show
    *Lemma X is available — Install…*. Both it and Lemma → Check for
    Updates… open Local settings on This computer with the update panel, and
    installing still asks natively first.
28. **Disk space after an update.** On a disposable installation, update
    v(N-1) → v(N) so migrations run. Before the new version is ready,
    `locald/runtime/macos/data.raw.before-migration` exists and This Mac →
    Overview shows *Backup from before the last update* with what deleting it
    frees (compare with `stat -f %b` × 512 for the allocated size, which is
    much larger: the clone shares its blocks). Once Lemma is ready the file is
    gone and `locald/locald.log` says why. Repeat with the backend made to fail
    after migrating: the backup stays, and is removed three days after it was
    taken -- dated by its inode change time, which nothing can set back, so the
    unit tests hold the three-day rule and QA confirms only that it survives
    the failed start. **Delete** asks natively; Cancel leaves it. **Free up space** removes
    `runtime/releases/` directories beyond two, runs `nerdctl images` in the
    guest before and after (only images no container uses and v(N) does not pin
    disappear), and `locald/disk-hygiene.json` records the time. Compare
    `stat -f %b locald/runtime/macos/data.raw` before and after deleting a
    large workspace and pressing Free up space: if the allocated size does not
    fall, check `discard_max_bytes` in the guest diagnostics -- zero means the
    VM is not passing discards through.
29. **Cancel hosted sign-in.** Choose Lemma Cloud on a fresh install, then
    press Cancel on the "Sign in with your browser" screen. The app returns to
    the Cloud-or-Local chooser, and quitting and reopening shows the chooser,
    not the sign-in.

## Runtime state and debugging

macOS state root:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Lemma
```

Key files:

```text
desktop-config.json
runtime/install.log
runtime/launch.log
runtime/releases/<version>-<artifact-identity>/
locald/network.json
locald/installation.id
locald/processes.json
locald/events.jsonl
locald/logs/
locald/runtime/macos/data.raw
locald/runtime/macos/console.log
```

Set `LEMMA_DESKTOP_DEVTOOLS=1` for the WKWebView inspector and
`LEMMA_DESKTOP_DEBUG=1` for protocol event output. The in-app Diagnostics view
is the preferred user-facing path; it returns bounded data, redacted two ways.

Values read out of `control.token` and the on-disk secret files are substituted
exactly. Everything else is masked **by shape** — vendor key prefixes, JWTs, and
whatever follows an `Authorization:` header — because the operator's 19 secrets
live in the OS credential vault, not on disk, and reading them back to redact
them would put every one of them into a diagnostics buffer. Treat the shape
pass as best effort: skim a log before pasting it into a support thread.

Development-only dynamic-port overrides require both variables:

```bash
export LEMMA_LOCALD_FRONTEND_PORT=49180
export LEMMA_LOCALD_BACKEND_PORT=49181
```

Packaged release builds ignore them.

## Release policy

`release-desktop.yml` builds signed online installers for macOS and Windows,
but attaches only the notarized macOS DMG and its update payload to the
release: the stable `latest.json` feed carries `darwin-aarch64` alone, so a
stable Windows install has no in-app update and is updated by installing the
next release by hand. Windows installers are workflow artifacts for testers;
nightlies publish a Windows feed entry. The run always builds the release tag,
never the ref it was dispatched from. `release-local-images.yml` publishes immutable host/guest runtimes
and the release manifest. The release gate requires the platform E2Es, size
breakdown, signatures, and runtime integrity checks.

Do not reintroduce:

- expanded runtimes in the public app;
- public offline/air-gapped claims;
- hardcoded managed ports;
- default localhost rewriting in the backend;
- Podman/Docker/Kreuzberg requirements in the Desktop journey;
- service health that accepts non-2xx or the wrong runtime generation.

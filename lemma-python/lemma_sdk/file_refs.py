"""File arguments for connector operations.

A connector operation that takes a file -- a Gmail attachment, a Drive upload
-- takes a *reference* to one, and the server reads it with the caller's own
access::

    pod.connectors.execute("gmail", "GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL", {
        "recipient_email": "anukul@lemma.work",
        "subject": "Q3",
        "body": "Attached.",
        "attachment": pod_file("/me/reports/q3.pdf"),
    })

These only build the dict; writing it by hand is equally valid.

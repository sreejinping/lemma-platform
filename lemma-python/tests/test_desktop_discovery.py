"""Finding a Lemma Desktop install from the state file it writes.

`--server local` resolves its endpoints from locald's `state.json` rather than
from fixed ports, and a gate decides which URLs in that file are believable.
The gate had a hostname spelled into it, which stopped being the only one an
install can serve under: a browser derives no registrable domain from
`*.localhost`, so an install that needs pod apps to work inside the workspace
serves itself under a loopback wildcard instead.

Nothing covered the gate before, and its failure is quiet -- discovery returns
None and the CLI reports the runtime as unavailable, which reads as "Desktop is
not running" rather than "the SDK did not recognise the address".

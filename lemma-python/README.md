# Lemma Python SDK

`lemma-sdk` is the Python client library for Lemma. It wraps a generated OpenAPI
client with a pod-first, ergonomic surface for tables, files, functions, agents,
workflows, schedules, surfaces, apps, and connectors.

It is the same SDK that runs **inside Lemma functions** (where the runtime injects
auth automatically) and in **standalone application code** (where you supply a
token). The CLI and TUI live in the sibling `lemma-cli` package.

- package name: `lemma-sdk`
- import root: `lemma_sdk`
- Python `>=3.14,<3.15` ([`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) recommended)

> **Reading the source.** In a Lemma sandbox the SDK is installed, and its source
> is readable where the interpreter found it:
> `python -c "import lemma_sdk; print(lemma_sdk.__path__[0])"`. When you need an
> exact signature or response shape, read it rather than guessing — e.g.
> `resources/data.py` under that directory.

## Install

The published package is `lemma-sdk`, not `lemma-python` — that is the directory
it is built from.

```bash
uv add lemma-sdk            # or: pip install lemma-sdk
```

From a checkout, for working on the SDK itself:

```bash
uv pip install .            # or: uv pip install --editable .
python -c "from lemma_sdk import Pod, Lemma; print(Pod, Lemma)"
```

**This package requires Python 3.14** (`requires-python = ">=3.14,<3.15"`), which
is not what `python3` is on current distributions or on macOS. Check before you
install, because the failure is quiet: on an older interpreter neither `pip` nor
`uv` errors — the resolver walks back to `0.6.2`, the last release that allowed
3.11, and installs that instead. You get an SDK two minors behind the API you
are calling and nothing says so. Confirm what you actually got with
`python -c "import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.version('lemma-sdk'))"`.

`uv` will provision 3.14 for you:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.14 && uv pip install lemma-sdk   # standalone environment
```

In a uv project, put `requires-python = ">=3.14"` in your `pyproject.toml`
before `uv add lemma-sdk`; otherwise the project's own floor is what makes the
resolver reach for the old release.

The `lemma` CLI is unaffected by any of this: `uv tool install lemma-terminal`
provisions its own interpreter, so the CLI works whatever `python3` on your
machine happens to be.

## Two entry points

| Class | Scope | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Pod` | one pod | almost everything — data, files, functions, agents, workflows, app operations |
| `Lemma` | org / global | org & pod discovery, org-level connector setup, tools, runtime profiles |

```python
from lemma_sdk import Pod, Lemma

pod = Pod.from_env()                    # token + pod id from env / CLI session
lemma = Lemma.from_env(org_id="org-id") # org-scoped client; lemma.pod("id") -> Pod
```

`Pod` is a context manager and owns an HTTP transport when constructed directly:

```python
with Pod.from_env() as pod:
    pod.functions.run("triage_ticket", {"ticket_id": "rec-1"})
```

`lemma.pod(...)` and `lemma.for_org(...)` are *views* of the client they come
from: same endpoint, same credential, same connection pool, so closing the
parent closes everything. Only a directly constructed `Pod`/`Lemma` owns a
transport of its own.

### Every call is synchronous

There is no async client. Each method makes a blocking HTTP request, and a
retried request sleeps (up to a few seconds) on the calling thread. That is what
you want in a script, a function handler doing one thing at a time, or a worker
thread — and it is not what you want on an event loop. From `async def` code
that also serves other work, hand each call to a thread:

```python
import asyncio

row = await asyncio.to_thread(pod.table("tickets").get, ticket_id)

# Fanning out? to_thread + gather runs the round trips concurrently; a plain
# loop of SDK calls serializes them and freezes the loop for the whole batch.
rows = await asyncio.gather(*(
    asyncio.to_thread(pod.table("tickets").get, tid) for tid in ticket_ids
))
```

## Authentication & configuration

The SDK resolves settings from explicit arguments first, then environment, then
the CLI config file (`~/.lemma/config.json`).

Environment variables:

```bash
export LEMMA_TOKEN="<access-token>"      # required if not using a CLI session
export LEMMA_POD_ID="<pod-id>"           # required for Pod.from_env()
export LEMMA_ORG_ID="<org-id>"           # required for org-scoped calls
export LEMMA_BASE_URL="https://api.lemma.work"
export LEMMA_AUTH_URL="https://lemma.work/auth"
export LEMMA_REFRESH_TOKEN="<refresh-token>"     # optional
export LEMMA_CONFIG_FILE="~/.lemma/config.json"  # optional override
export LEMMA_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1              # local/self-signed only
```

`LEMMA_REFRESH_TOKEN` is what keeps a long-running process working past its
access token's lifetime: on a 401 the client exchanges it once, replaces the
token in memory, and replays the request. Nothing is written to
`~/.lemma/config.json` — the refreshed token lives for the process. A refresh
token found in a CLI session is used the same way, unless you passed `token=`
yourself, in which case the credential stays exactly what you supplied.

Inside a Lemma function, `LEMMA_TOKEN` (a workload token scoped to the function's
grants) and `LEMMA_POD_ID` are injected for you — just call `Pod.from_env()`.

Explicit construction (no env needed):

```python
pod = Pod(pod_id="pod-id", org_id="org-id", token="token",
          base_url="https://api.lemma.work")
```

When `LEMMA_TOKEN` is unset, settings fall back to the selected server in the CLI
config:

```json
{
  "active_server": "cloud",
  "servers": {
    "cloud": {
      "base_url": "https://api.lemma.work",
      "auth_url": "https://lemma.work/auth",
      "defaults": { "org_id": "org-id", "pod_id": "pod-id" }
    }
  }
}
```

(Legacy `active_context` / `contexts` keys are still accepted and translated.)
Install and manage the CLI from `lemma-cli`; see `lemma-cli/SETUP.md`.

## Response shapes — read this first

Every method returns a typed response object. Call `.to_dict()` for plain data,
then unwrap:

| Call | `.to_dict()` returns | Rows under |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `records.create / get / update` | the **bare record object** (no envelope) | top-level |
| `table.create / get / update` | the table detail object | top-level |
| `records.list`, `table.list` | `{"items": [...], "total": N, "limit": N, "next_page_token": ...}` | `["items"]` |
| `bulk_create / bulk_update / bulk_delete` | `{"count": N}` | `["count"]` |
| `query(sql)` | `{"items": [...], "total": N}` | `["items"]` |
| `connectors.execute` | `{"result": ...}` | `["result"]` |
| `functions.run` | `{"status": ..., "output_data": ..., "logs": ...}` | top-level |

Single-record create/get/update return the record directly — there is **no**
`{"data": {...}}` envelope. Call `.to_dict()` and use the result as the row.
The `pod.records` helpers already unwrap to a plain dict for you. The bulk
helpers return the integer `count` directly.

## Pod facades

`pod.tables` · `pod.records` · `pod.queries` · `pod.files` · `pod.functions` ·
`pod.agents` · `pod.workflows` · `pod.schedules` · `pod.conversations` ·
`pod.members` · `pod.apps` · `pod.surfaces` · `pod.connectors`

Plus helpers: `pod.table(name)` (bound single-table helper), `pod.query(sql)`,
`pod.generated` (raw OpenAPI client escape hatch).

### Tables & records — full CRUD

```python
t = pod.table("tickets")

row = t.create({"title": "Refund", "status": "new"})   # already a plain dict
ticket_id = row["id"]

row = t.get(ticket_id)                            # bare record dict, no envelope
t.update(ticket_id, {"status": "resolved"})       # only passed fields change
t.delete(ticket_id)

# Writing more than a row or two? Use the batch form -- one round trip instead
# of N. A loop of t.create(...) pays a full request per row.
t.bulk_create([{"title": f"Refund {i}", "status": "new"} for i in range(50)])

rows = pod.records.list(
    "tickets", limit=50,
    filter=[
        {"field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": "new"},
        {"field": "priority", "op": "ne", "value": "low"},
    ],
    sort=[{"field": "created_at", "direction": "desc"}],
).to_dict()["items"]

# `list` returns one page — `limit` defaults to 20 and the rest is behind
# `next_page_token`. When the answer has to be complete, page to exhaustion:
every_open = pod.records.list_all(
    "tickets", filter=[{"field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": "new"}]
)   # -> list of plain row dicts; t.list_all() is the same walk for one table

totals = pod.query(
    "select status, count(*) as total from tickets group by status"
).to_dict()["items"]
```

The `pod.records` / `pod.table(...)` create/get/update helpers return the bare
record as a plain dict (no `.to_dict()`, no `["data"]` unwrap). `list` and
`query` return response objects; call `.to_dict()` and read `["items"]`;
`list_all` returns the rows themselves.

Record data is dynamic because table schemas are user-defined.

#### RLS vs shared tables

Tables carry an `enable_rls` flag that **defaults to `true`** (row-level
security on). With RLS on, each row is owned by its creator: non-admin members
read/update/delete **only their own rows** (other users' rows are invisible —
cross-user access returns 404), while pod admins see and manage every row. This
is the right default for per-user/personal data.

Set `enable_rls: false` for SHARED/reference/team tables that all members should
see and mutate. RLS only scopes *which* rows a non-admin can touch — it does not
change the permission a write needs: writing any table requires the
`DATASTORE_RECORD_WRITE` permission (POD_USER and above), RLS or not. The
read-only `query` endpoint can join across tables only when they are non-RLS.

### Bulk record operations

Reach for these whenever you write more than a couple of rows: each one is a
single request, where a loop of `create` is one request per row. The same three
methods exist on the bound helper — `pod.table("tickets").bulk_create(rows)` —
so you never have to leave the table handle to get a batch.

```python
# create: row dicts (ids generated)
created_count = pod.records.bulk_create("ticket_events", [
    {"ticket_id": ticket_id, "kind": "created"},
    {"ticket_id": ticket_id, "kind": "triaged"},
])

# update: FLAT dicts that MUST include the primary key
updated_count = pod.records.bulk_update("tickets", [
    {"id": id_a, "status": "resolved"},
    {"id": id_b, "status": "waiting", "priority": "urgent"},
])

# delete: list of primary-key values
deleted_count = pod.records.bulk_delete("tickets", [id_a, id_b])
```

### Files — searchable documents (built-in RAG)

Files uploaded to a pod are **automatically indexed**: text is extracted,
chunked, and embedded, so they become searchable with no separate vector DB or
infra. That makes files the pod's built-in retrieval-augmented generation store.

Only **document** formats are indexed: PDF, DOC/DOCX, ODT, RTF, Markdown, plain
text, HTML, EPUB. Data/binary formats (CSV, TSV, JSON, YAML, XLSX, images,
email) are stored but **not** indexed (status `NOT_REQUIRED`) and never appear in
search — so keep structured data in **tables** and prose/documents in **files**.
`search_enabled` toggles indexing per file; status flows
PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED (searchable) / NOT_REQUIRED / FAILED, and only
COMPLETED documents are searchable. Documents are also converted to markdown.

`/me` is each user's **private** per-user tree (only the owner sees their `/me`
files); all other paths are pod-shared, and folder grants cascade to every
descendant.

```python
pod.files.create_folder("/reports", description="Generated reports")
pod.files.upload("/tmp/summary.md", directory_path="/reports")

# Plain search (defaults to the whole pod):
hits = pod.files.search("refund policy").to_dict()

# Directory-scoped RAG + method selection:
hits = pod.files.search(
    "refund policy",
    scope_path="/knowledge",     # restrict to a folder
    scope_mode="SUBTREE",        # SUBTREE = folder + all descendants (default); DIRECT = immediate children only
    search_method="HYBRID",      # TEXT (full-text), VECTOR (semantic), or HYBRID
).to_dict()

md  = pod.files.download_markdown("/knowledge/policy.pdf")           # converted markdown bytes
kids = pod.files.list_children("/knowledge/policy.pdf")              # derived child files (md, figures, pages)
raw = pod.files.download("/knowledge/policy.pdf")                     # bytes
```

### Functions, agents, workflows

```python
run = pod.functions.run("triage_ticket", {"ticket_id": "rec-1"}).to_dict()
# run["status"], run["output_data"], run["logs"]

agent = pod.agents.get("triage").to_dict()
conv = pod.conversations.create_for_agent("triage", title="Triage")
pod.conversations.send(str(conv.to_dict()["id"]), "Classify ticket rec-1")

wf_run = pod.workflows.create_run("nightly_review").to_dict()
# Workflow inputs are collected by FORM nodes mid-run, not at start; submit them with
# pod.workflows.submit_form(wf_run["id"], node_id="<form_node>", inputs={"limit": 10})
```

### Connectors (calling external apps)

`pod.connectors.execute(auth_config, operation, payload)` runs a third-party
operation. The first argument is the **auth config name** (often the app id), the
operation id and payload come from discovery, and the response is under
`["result"]`.

```python
sent = pod.connectors.execute(
    "workspace-gmail",          # auth config name
    "GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL",         # operation id from discovery
    {"recipient_email": "a@example.com", "subject": "Hi", "body": "..."},
).to_dict()["result"]

# discover before you call:
matches = pod.connectors.operations.search("workspace-gmail", "send email")
schema  = pod.connectors.operations.get("workspace-gmail", "GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL")
```

Operation ids and payload keys differ between the `lemma` and `composio`
providers — confirm with discovery for the provider your org installed. Don't pass
`account_id` unless pinning a specific account; the backend resolves the fixed or
invoking-user account from the token.

## Org & global usage (`Lemma`)

```python
lemma = Lemma.from_env(org_id="org-id")

org   = lemma.org.get()
pods  = lemma.pods.list()
pod   = lemma.pod("pod-id")          # -> Pod sharing this transport
me    = lemma.user.profile()

# org-level connector setup
auth_configs = lemma.connectors.auth_configs.list()
accounts     = lemma.connectors.accounts.list(app="gmail")

# first-party tools
results = lemma.tools.web_search("vendor SLA policy", max_results=5)
```

Facades: `lemma.orgs` · `lemma.org` · `lemma.pods` · `lemma.user` ·
`lemma.connectors` · `lemma.tools` · `lemma.agent_hosts` · `lemma.web_logins` ·
`lemma.org_runtime`.

## Writing a function

A Lemma function is a Python file with header comments declaring its types, plus a
handler `(ctx, data) -> output`:

```python
#input_type_name: TriageInput
#output_type_name: TriageResult
#function_name: triage_ticket

from pydantic import BaseModel
from lemma_sdk import FunctionContext, Pod

class TriageInput(BaseModel):
    ticket_id: str

class TriageResult(BaseModel):
    status: str

async def triage_ticket(ctx: FunctionContext, data: TriageInput) -> TriageResult:
    pod = Pod.from_env()    # authenticated as this function's workload principal
    pod.table("tickets").update(data.ticket_id, {"status": "triaged"})
    return TriageResult(status="triaged")
```

`FunctionContext` fields: `pod_id`, `function_id`, `user_id`, `user_email`,
`config`. The function runs with **zero default access** — grant it the tables,
folders, and apps it touches (see the `lemma-builder` skill / `lemma functions
permissions`).

## Typed models

`lemma_sdk.models` re-exports the common response types with friendly names:

```python
from lemma_sdk.models import Record, FunctionRun, OperationExecution, Agent, Function

record: Record = pod.records.create("tickets", {"title": "Typed"})
```

Generated request models live under `lemma_sdk.openapi_client.models` (e.g.
`CreateTableRequest`) for endpoints you build payloads for by hand.

## Errors

```python
from lemma_sdk import LemmaAPIError, LemmaConfigError

try:
    pod.records.get("tickets", "missing")
except LemmaAPIError as e:
    print(e.status_code, e.code, e.message)
except LemmaConfigError:
    ...   # missing token / pod id / unreadable config
```

## Generated client escape hatch

For endpoints not yet wrapped by the ergonomic SDK:

```python
generated = pod.generated   # authenticated; same base URL/token/timeout/SSL
```

## Testing against a real Lemma API

Unit tests cover wrapper behavior; an opt-in integration scenario runs real
end-to-end work against a running API. Start the local stack from the repo root:

```bash
make dev
```

Then from `lemma-python`:

```bash
export LEMMA_TOKEN="<access-token>"
LEMMA_RUN_CONNECTOR=1 uv run --with pytest --with pytest-asyncio \
  pytest tests/integration -m integration -s
```

This development-only scenario defaults to the fixed API port used by
`make dev`; a packaged Desktop installation instead discovers its dynamic
endpoint through locald. The scenario falls back to the CLI auth session if
`LEMMA_TOKEN` is unset. Point elsewhere with
`LEMMA_CONNECTOR_BASE_URL` / `LEMMA_CONNECTOR_TOKEN`. The scenario creates a
fresh org and pod, exercises tables/records/query/files/functions/agents/
workflows/connectors, prints a summary, and deletes the pod.

## Regenerate the SDK

Run the backend locally, then regenerate from its OpenAPI spec:

```bash
bash scripts/generate_openapi_client.sh
OPENAPI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json OPENAPI_INSECURE=1 \
  bash scripts/generate_openapi_client.sh
```

Generator env vars: `LEMMA_API_URL`, `OPENAPI_URL`, `OPENAPI_INSECURE`,
`LEMMA_SSL_NO_VERIFY`.

## Development checks

```bash
uv run ruff check lemma_sdk tests
uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests
```

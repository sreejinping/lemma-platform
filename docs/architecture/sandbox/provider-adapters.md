# Sandbox provider adapters

**Status:** Docker and E2B implemented and verified; Agent Host (Desktop host
execution) implemented against the op contract; Kubernetes deferred

**Parent:** [Sandbox fabric](README.md)

**Protocol:** [Sandbox protocol](sandbox-protocol.md)

**Provider test contract:** [Testing strategy](testing-strategy.md)

## 1. Purpose

This document maps the portable sandbox-runtime ports onto Docker, Kubernetes, and E2B.
Adapters are allowed to use different data-plane transports. They are not allowed to
change public semantics, invent their own retry policy, persist secrets, or expose a
provider ID to callers.

The implementation target is one adapter package per provider with explicit
lifecycle, process, Python, filesystem, port-access, inventory, and admission
components. An aggregate adapter may delegate several ports to one component, but
one monolithic provider class is not required or preferred.

## 2. Capability matrix

| Capability | Docker | Kubernetes | E2B | Agent Host |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace files survive release | Named volume | Per-workspace PVC | Native sandbox persistence | The user's own folder on their Mac |
| Process/Python state survives release | No contract | No | Not exposed as a contract | No |
| Function persistent storage | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | No function sandboxes |
| Native foreground/background exec | Engine exec | Pods exec | Commands API | `process.*` ops |
| Native reconnectable process handle | Partial | No | Yes | Yes, by `process_id` |
| Native PTY reconnect | Partial | Connection-scoped | Yes | Yes |
| Native stateful Python contexts | No | No | Yes | No (`SandboxCapabilityUnsupported`) |
| Native file API | Archive API is insufficient | No | Yes | `file.*` ops, 1 MiB chunks |
| Workspace control runtime required | Yes | Yes | No | No (exec-server) |
| Provider-native auto-resume | No | No | Disabled; lifecycle is explicit | Re-opens on `workspace_not_open` |
| Strong production isolation | No | With approved RuntimeClass | Managed microVM boundary | Seatbelt profile, the paired user only |
| Public ingress for functions | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled | n/a |
| Port reach (`PORT_REACH`) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No; the VM reaches the Mac's loopback through the relay |
| Provider create rate admission | Configured local limit | Configured pool/resource limit | E2B project limit | None |

The portable contract is the intersection required by the selected profile, not the
lowest capability of every provider. Provider-only capabilities are implementation
optimizations and cannot become implicit caller requirements.

## 3. Shared adapter rules

### 3.1 Metadata and naming

Every physical allocation carries:

```text
managed-by=sandbox
environment=<environment>
owner=<deployment owner>
workload-kind=workspace|function
logical-id=<uuid>
allocation-id=<uuid>
allocation-token=<uuid>
profile-digest=sha256:<hex>
```

Docker labels, Kubernetes labels/annotations, and E2B metadata contain the same
logical evidence. Values that exceed provider label restrictions move to annotations
or metadata, while the allocation token remains queryable.

Provider resource names derive from the workload kind plus a collision-resistant
suffix, not directly from untrusted input:

```text
ab-w-<logical-id-prefix>-<allocation-id-prefix>
ab-f-<logical-id-prefix>-<allocation-id-prefix>
```

The full UUIDs remain in metadata. Names are never used as proof of ownership.

### 3.2 Provider call discipline

- Each control-plane call is bounded by the remaining caller deadline and an
  adapter-specific maximum request timeout.
- Create is dispatched once per allocation token.
- Exact-ID inspect, connect, release, and delete may be retried only under the
  shared error contract.
- Inventory is paginated and runs only in reconciliation/operations paths.
- Provider response bodies and error headers are normalized once at the adapter
  boundary.
- Provider handles may be cached in process memory, but durable correctness uses
  allocation and provider IDs from PostgreSQL.
- Adapter shutdown closes SDK clients and streaming connections without destroying
  allocations.

### 3.3 Readiness

Readiness is profile-specific:

- workspace: generic execution, Python context, and filesystem access work;
- function: the immutable resident runtime answers `/healthz` on its private port
  with the expected runtime ABI;
- port access is validated lazily when requested and does not block sandbox
  publication.

No adapter treats provider object state alone as proof that required data-plane
operations are ready.

### 3.4 Runtime artifacts

All providers consume artifacts from one release manifest:

```text
release_id
workspace_profile_digest
function_profile_digest
workspace_runtime_protocol_version
function_runtime_abi
docker_workspace_image_digest
docker_function_image_digest
kubernetes_workspace_pod_template_digest
kubernetes_function_pod_template_digest
e2b_workspace_template_build_id
e2b_function_template_build_id
```

The sandbox runtime starts only a profile whose provider artifact matches the configured
release manifest. Mutable image tags are rejected outside local development.

## 4. Private workspace runtime

Docker and Kubernetes use a small `workspace-runtime`; E2B does not.

The runtime provides adapter-private equivalents of the process, Python-session,
filesystem, and health operations. It excludes function execution, queues, artifact
installation, provider lifecycle, browser proxying, and durable business state.

Requirements:

- one runtime per workspace allocation;
- authenticated private HTTP/2 or Connect transport plus WebSocket/binary stream for
  PTY/output;
- per-allocation random credential delivered at creation, read once, removed from
  process environment, and never inherited by children;
- request authentication before body buffering;
- user commands run as the unprivileged sandbox user;
- Python contexts are separate child processes, one per session;
- commands and PTYs are separate process groups;
- bounded output and sequence-numbered reconnect buffers;
- atomic filesystem operations constrained to allowed roots;
- clean shutdown terminates all managed descendants;
- no listening public interface and no provider credential.

Network policy permits the sandbox manager to reach the runtime. User processes may
share the sandbox network namespace but do not possess its credential. Compromise of
the runtime affects that user's workspace, which is already the sandbox trust
boundary; it must not grant access to the sandbox runtime, the provider API, another sandbox,
or host control sockets.

## 5. Docker adapter

### 5.1 Scope and client

Docker is for local development, conformance, and trusted single-tenant deployments.
It is not accepted as a hostile multi-tenant production isolation boundary.

Use an asynchronous Docker Engine HTTP client over the configured Unix socket or
explicit TLS endpoint. Do not invoke the `docker` CLI with subprocesses. The manager
must never mount the Docker socket into a user sandbox.

Docker's Engine API models exec as create followed by start and supports attached
stdin/stdout/PTY streams. See the
[Docker Engine API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/).

### 5.2 Workspace allocation

Create:

1. reserve a provider allocation in sandbox PostgreSQL;
2. create or reuse the named volume recorded for the logical workspace storage row;
3. create the container from the workspace image digest;
4. mount the volume at the sandbox user's home (`/home/user`) and no host
   project paths;
5. on the installed stack, attach the container to the manager's private network
   without publishing runtime or app ports; a standalone development fallback may
   publish required ports on `127.0.0.1` with random host ports;
6. apply CPU, memory, PID, and ephemeral-storage limits;
7. drop Linux capabilities and prohibit privilege escalation;
8. start the container and wait for the private workspace runtime;
9. run one authenticated process/filesystem readiness operation;
10. bind the exact container ID to the allocation and the exact volume ID to the
    logical workspace storage row.

The container entrypoint starts only static workspace services. Dynamic session
credentials are passed per runtime operation.

Release:

1. The sandbox runtime performs portable quiescence through the workspace runtime;
2. revoke port grants;
3. stop the exact container with a bounded grace period;
4. retain the named volume and container metadata;
5. release active-compute admission.

Resume starts the exact stopped container when its image/profile still matches.
Otherwise the sandbox runtime removes the old container, retains the volume, creates a new
container from the current profile, and increments the allocation epoch.

Permanent deletion removes the exact container and then the exact volume from the
logical workspace storage row. The tombstone is finalized only after both are
confirmed absent. Volume deletion never uses a broad name prefix.

### 5.3 Function allocation

- Create an ephemeral container from the function image digest.
- Mount only tmpfs/ephemeral writable paths; do not create or attach a named volume.
- Keep general `/tmp` mounted `noexec`. Mount a separate private executable tmpfs
  at `/run/lemma-function-cache` for digest-verified artifacts, because native
  wheels must map executable shared-library segments.
- Start `lemma-function-runtime serve` as PID 1 behind `tini`.
- Publish port 8090 only to the trusted service network shared by the sandbox runtime and the
  backend in the installed topology, or through a loopback-bound random host port
  when both run on one standalone development host.
- Probe `/healthz` before marking the allocation active.
- Lease the current allocation's runtime address to the trusted backend. In the
  installed topology this is a private container-network address; standalone
  development uses a loopback-published random port. The sandbox runtime is not in the
  per-invocation data path.
- Keep revision worker processes inside the resident runtime. A worker imports one
  immutable revision once, handles one invocation at a time, and is reused only for
  that exact `(function_id, artifact_sha256)`.
- Bound total workers and cached revision pools. Least-recently-used idle revision
  pools are terminated before their cache budget can grow without bound.
- Remove the container after its endpoint-lease protection and idle threshold
  expire, or on profile drain.

The backend owns the public `function_run_id` and run transition. The sandbox runtime owns
only the function allocation and direct runtime lease; it does not create a
generic sandbox-runtime process row for each function invocation.

### 5.4 Files and port access

Workspace filesystem operations use the private workspace runtime, not shell/base64
commands. Docker archive APIs may be used for bulk import/export only after path and
symlink validation.

User port access goes through a sandbox signed reverse proxy. On the installed
stack, the manager reaches the container IP over their shared private network and
the sandbox port is not host-published. A standalone development fallback may proxy
to a loopback-bound random host port. Raw host ports and Docker container addresses
are never returned to users. A trusted backend may receive the current function
allocation's address from `runtime:lease`; the address is allocation-fenced and
profile-bound.

### 5.5 Inventory and recovery

List containers and volumes by exact `managed-by`, owner, and environment labels.
Unknown-create recovery matches the allocation token and then records the exact
container ID. A container with matching logical ID but a different token is never
adopted.

## 6. Kubernetes adapter

### 6.1 Scope and client

Use `kubernetes_asyncio` for API operations, watches, exec streams, and cancellation.
Do not wrap the synchronous Kubernetes client in worker threads. Watch a specific
resource version for Pod/PVC state transitions instead of polling every second.

Kubernetes Pods are disposable. A replacement Pod has a different UID and is a new
physical allocation even when the logical ID remains unchanged. See
[Kubernetes Pod lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/).

Production function and untrusted workspace profiles require an approved sandbox
`RuntimeClass`, initially gVisor or Kata, on a dedicated tainted node pool. Plain
runc is permitted only for disposable development/conformance clusters.

### 6.2 Workspace storage

Create one dynamically provisioned PVC per logical workspace:

```text
access mode: ReadWriteOnce by default
mount: /home/user
owner labels: workload kind, logical ID, environment
deletion policy: retained across Pod deletion; deleted on logical permanent delete
```

The PVC lifecycle is independent of an individual Pod, which is the required
portable filesystem guarantee. See
[Kubernetes persistent volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

PVC creation is its own exact resource operation and survives unknown Pod creation.
The adapter never substitutes a different workspace's PVC by name or label.

### 6.3 Workspace Pod

The Pod template contains:

- one workspace container using an immutable image digest;
- home-directory PVC mount;
- ephemeral `/tmp` and runtime-state volumes;
- no Docker/container runtime socket;
- no writable hostPath;
- `automountServiceAccountToken: false`;
- nonprivileged security context, seccomp, capability drop, PID/resource limits;
- startup/readiness probe for the private workspace runtime;
- labels for network policy and exact allocation metadata;
- required `RuntimeClass`, node selector, and tolerations in production.

The sandbox runtime connects to the private runtime through the Pod IP on the cluster network.
A default-deny NetworkPolicy permits ingress only from the sandbox manager identity
and egress according to the workspace profile. No Service or Ingress is created for
the control runtime.

Release quiesces the runtime and deletes the exact Pod while retaining the PVC. The
allocation becomes released only after the Pod UID is absent. Resume creates a new
Pod against the same PVC and increments the allocation epoch. Permanent deletion
deletes the Pod and then the exact PVC.

### 6.4 Function Pod

The function Pod differs deliberately:

- no PVC;
- no workspace runtime control service;
- no Service, Ingress, public port, or service-account token;
- immutable function image digest;
- ephemeral writable root/cache with strict quota;
- production sandbox RuntimeClass and dedicated node pool;
- default-deny ingress;
- direct egress only to the Lemma runtime gateway and controlled egress gateway;
  the egress gateway enforces revision-declared public HTTPS destinations.

The container runs `lemma-function-runtime serve` continuously on port 8090.
The sandbox runtime reaches the Pod IP over the cluster network, validates `/healthz`, and
proxies short-lived signed invocation/cancellation requests. No Kubernetes Service
or Ingress is needed. Revision workers, exact-operation cancellation, artifact
verification, and callbacks use the same runtime protocol as Docker and E2B.

The Pod is deleted after five idle minutes, when drained, or after an unrecoverable
sandbox failure. A later run creates a fresh Pod and downloads exact artifacts again.

### 6.5 Readiness and watches

Pod phase alone is insufficient. The adapter waits for:

- scheduled Pod and running container;
- readiness condition for the workspace runtime or function resident runtime;
- matching Pod UID and allocation labels;
- no terminating timestamp;
- PVC bound/mounted for workspace profiles.

Watch expiration restarts from the latest resource version under the same deadline.
It does not start another Pod. `409 AlreadyExists` triggers exact resource inspect
and allocation-token validation.

### 6.6 Inventory and recovery

Inventory is namespace- and label-scoped. A Pod or PVC is adopted only when its full
allocation token matches a durable create attempt. Exact UID deletion/not-found is
the terminal compute postcondition. A missing list result is not.

## 7. E2B adapter

### 7.1 SDK and templates

Use the official asynchronous E2B SDK and separate immutable templates:

- `workspace-python-v1` derives from or includes the E2B Code Interpreter runtime
  needed for code contexts;
- `function-python-v1` contains only the stateless function launcher/runtime.

Static processes are started and proven ready during template build. E2B snapshots
the running process into the template, so no per-sandbox bootstrap loop is required.
Create-time environment is not visible to template start commands and therefore
must contain no startup dependency. See
[E2B start and ready commands](https://e2b.dev/docs/template/start-ready-command).

Provider create uses the current official async SDK and pins its tested version in
the release lock:

```python
await AsyncSandbox.create(
    template=<exact profile template>,
    metadata=<allocation metadata>,
    secure=True,
    network=<profile policy>,
    lifecycle=<workload-specific lifecycle>,
    timeout=<bounded initial timeout>,
)
```

The documented create request supports secured access, lifecycle, outbound network,
and public-traffic controls; see the
[E2B create-sandbox API](https://e2b.dev/docs/api-reference/sandboxes/create-sandbox).

The workspace template exposes no sandbox-runtime control runtime. The function template
starts the private resident function runtime on port 8090 and proves it ready during
the template build.

### 7.2 Workspace lifecycle

Use explicit pause with provider auto-resume disabled:

```python
lifecycle={
    "on_timeout": "pause",
    "auto_resume": False,
}
```

The sandbox runtime—not the provider timeout—is the five-minute logical idle scheduler. It
updates logical activity on accepted operations, then its distributed idle worker
claims and quiesces the workspace before calling pause. Before an explicit or idle
release, the sandbox runtime:

1. blocks new work;
2. deletes Code Interpreter contexts;
3. kills managed commands and PTYs;
4. stops managed browser/app processes;
5. clears ephemeral credentials and browser state;
6. calls exact sandbox pause.

The E2B timeout is a longer safety bound than the five-minute logical threshold,
and delegated credentials expire before that bound. Provider timeout is a safety
fallback, not a second lifecycle controller.

Thus the paused sandbox contains the static clean template/runtime state plus
workspace files, not live delegated credentials. Resume is an an explicit sandbox-runtime
operation against the exact sandbox ID and produces a new allocation epoch before
new data-plane work is accepted. Native file or command traffic cannot silently
resume a sandbox behind the lifecycle controller. See
[persistence](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/persistence) and
[automatic resume](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/auto-resume).

Paused E2B sandboxes are retained indefinitely by the provider, so the sandbox runtime's
configured retention worker must explicitly kill them.

### 7.3 Workspace profile replacement

An E2B sandbox filesystem is native to that physical sandbox, unlike a Docker
volume or Kubernetes PVC. A profile replacement therefore fences and quiesces the
old allocation, destroys its exact sandbox ID, increments the storage generation,
and creates a fresh sandbox from the new immutable template. Availability and
profile correctness take precedence over attempting an implicit cross-sandbox
file migration. Ordinary pause/resume still reconnects the same exact sandbox and
preserves its filesystem.

### 7.4 Workspace execution

Map ports directly:

| Sandbox runtime port | E2B API |
| --- | --- |
| Foreground/background process | `sandbox.commands.run` |
| Reconnect/inspect/list | command PID, `commands.connect`, `commands.list` |
| stdin | native command stdin API |
| PTY create/reconnect/input/resize/kill | `sandbox.pty` |
| Python session | Code Interpreter code context |
| Files | `sandbox.files` |
| Port access | secured `get_host` route plus traffic access token |

E2B's command APIs expose background handles, PID reconnect, list, kill, stdin, and
custom process tags; its PTY API supports reconnect and resize. See
[E2B background commands](https://e2b.dev/docs/commands/background),
[Process Start API](https://e2b.dev/docs/api-reference/process/start), and
[interactive PTY](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/pty).

Use `operation_id` as the provider process tag when supported. The bounded
manager-local handle records the acknowledged PID. Every stdin/resize/terminate
operation verifies that the PID still carries the expected operation tag. An
ambiguous start is reported as `UNKNOWN_DISPATCH` and is never resubmitted.

One E2B Code Interpreter context maps to one sandbox session. Context cwd matches
the session cwd; context restart maps to session restart. See
[E2B code contexts](https://e2b.dev/docs/code-interpreting/contexts).

### 7.5 Function lifecycle and execution

Function E2B sandboxes are stateless and never paused:

```python
lifecycle={
    "on_timeout": "kill",
    "auto_resume": False,
}
```

The immutable template starts `lemma-function-runtime serve` on port 8090 and waits
for that port during build. On allocation readiness the sandbox runtime connects by exact
sandbox ID and validates the runtime health endpoint.

For each direct endpoint lease and subsequent invocation:

1. The sandbox runtime resolves `sandbox.get_host(8090)`, obtains the sandbox's
   `traffic_access_token`, and returns an HTTPS base URL plus an opaque
   `E2B-Traffic-Access-Token` request header to the trusted backend;
2. The sandbox runtime extends the sandbox timeout at lease acquisition to cover the lease
   horizon; it does not proxy ordinary invocations;
3. the backend caches the allocation/profile-fenced lease within its absolute
   expiry;
4. the backend atomically starts the run, then sends the complete protocol-v2
   envelope and cached delegated function-session bearer directly to E2B's secured
   gateway;
5. the resident runtime uses that bearer to download the exact verified artifact
   on a cache miss and leases an exact revision worker. API invocations return
   their terminal report directly; JOB invocations post the terminal report with
   the same bearer;
6. cancellation uses the current direct lease and kills only the matching
   function/run worker group;
7. The sandbox runtime kills the exact sandbox after its protected lease/idle horizon.

No runtime claim, callback capability, heartbeat, or provider process polling is
used. The invocation response and durable JOB callback are guarded by the backend
run state. An ambiguous invocation response is not replayed. A pre-runtime secured
gateway rejection invalidates the lease and permits one fresh-allocation retry.

### 7.6 Network and ports

Workspace public app traffic uses E2B secured access and short-lived sandbox grants.
Raw traffic tokens are resolved from the connected E2B handle, kept only in adapter
memory for the upstream request, and never persisted or returned to backend callers.

Every sandbox is created with `allow_public_traffic` false; E2B's authenticated TLS traffic
gateway remains reachable with the per-sandbox traffic token. For the initial
release their outbound network allowlist contains only the exact Lemma runtime
gateway host needed for artifact, SDK, and JOB callback traffic. DNS needed to
resolve that host is provider-controlled. If the selected E2B template/account
cannot enforce this restriction, the function profile is rejected rather than
weakened. Revision-declared third-party egress is a later gateway feature, not an
unrestricted direct-internet fallback.

### 7.7 Create ambiguity, capacity, and events

E2B assigns the sandbox ID and does not document a client idempotency key. The sandbox runtime
therefore commits the allocation token before create and includes it in metadata.
An ambiguous create is resolved through:

1. signed `sandbox.lifecycle.created` webhook metadata;
2. metadata-filtered sandbox listing as background fallback;
3. exact-ID binding once one object is found.

The create call is never repeated for that token. Webhook handlers verify signatures
and deduplicate delivery IDs. See
[E2B lifecycle webhooks](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/lifecycle-events-webhooks)
and [listing sandboxes](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/list).

Provider project concurrency and create rate are sandbox-runtime admission inputs. E2B 429
responses update one distributed provider-scope `blocked_until`; adapter-local retry
loops are forbidden. See [E2B billing and limits](https://e2b.dev/docs/billing).

## 8. Agent Host adapter (Desktop host execution)

See [Host execution on Desktop](../desktop-host-execution.md) for who gets it
and why. This section is the adapter.

### 8.1 Where it sits

`build_provider` wraps the configured provider in `HostRoutingProvider` on a
Desktop install (`DEPLOYMENT_KIND=desktop`) and returns it unchanged anywhere
else. The router sends a call to `AgentHostSandboxProvider`
(`app/modules/workspace/providers/agent_host.py`) only for a **host sandbox**,
and everything else -- every VM workspace, every function sandbox, every sweep
-- to the configured provider as before.

A host sandbox is recognised by its id, which is where the choice is recorded:
a UUIDv8 tagged `lmhost`, derived from the conversation
(`domain/host_execution.host_sandbox_id`). Nothing else the platform mints is a
v8, so the route needs no lookup and can never change for the life of the
sandbox. Its instance rows record provider `agent_host`. One conversation has
one host sandbox; the user's VM workspace keeps its own id, and the browser
stays there.

Nothing stores which Agent Host a host sandbox runs on or which folder it
opened. The host is the one the conversation's most recent host run recorded
choosing (in that run's `execution` metadata), read per operation through the
agent module's `host_for_host_sandbox`; the sandbox row's slug names the
conversation. The folder is the Mac's to remember: it keeps each
conversation's root on its own disk and prefers it on every re-open. See
[desktop host execution §5 and §9](../desktop-host-execution.md#9-the-backend-half).

### 8.2 Mapping

| Provider call | Op |
| --- | --- |
| `create` | none: selection opens the workspace on the host it chose (`open_workspace`), and an op answered `workspace_not_open` re-opens it once |
| `wait_ready`, `inspect` | none: open is synchronous, and the next op is the liveness check |
| `release`, `destroy` | `workspace.close`; offline counts as closed |
| volumes, `list_objects` | none: there is nothing to adopt or reclaim |
| processes | `process.start` / `read` / `input` / `resize` / `terminate` / `list` |
| files | `file.stat` / `list` / `mkdir` / `read` / `write` / `move` / `delete` |
| `deliver_secret` | `secret.deliver` |
| Python sessions, `reach_port` | `SandboxCapabilityUnsupported` |

Reads and writes move in chunks of at most 1 MiB. A write sends every chunk
under one `upload_id` and only the last with `final` and the digest.

### 8.3 Failures

`detail.kind` maps to `SandboxPathNotFound` (`not_found`), `SandboxPathConflict`
(`already_exists`, `not_a_directory`, `is_a_directory`, `digest_mismatch`),
`SandboxProcessNotFound` (`process_not_found`), `SandboxUnavailable`
(`exec_server_unavailable` and anything the host marks retryable),
`SandboxOperationAmbiguous` (`timeout`, and a link that closed mid-op), and
`SandboxRejected` for the rest (`permission_denied`, `outside_workspace`,
`too_large`, `invalid_request`, `io_error`), including `host_offline` -- "This
Mac is not connected" -- which is definitive for the call rather than waited
out. `timeout` is retryable on the host's word but may have taken effect, so
it is reported as ambiguous rather than retried.
`workspace_not_open` re-opens from the binding and retries once.

## 9. Provider conformance declarations

Adapters do not self-assert production capability. A release manifest records the
conformance evidence for each `(provider, profile digest, protocol version)`:

```text
test run ID and commit
provider/account/cluster class
portable capability results
provider-specific lifecycle results
security profile result
warm/resume/cold latency distributions
create rate and concurrency observations
known deviations
expiry/revalidation date
```

The sandbox runtime startup in production rejects a profile/provider combination without a
passing, nonexpired conformance record unless an explicit audited override exists.

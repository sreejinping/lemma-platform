# Agent Host in the desktop app

How the Agent Host is supervised, controlled, and reported from Lemma Desktop.
For the sidecar's own architecture — the ACP bridge, adapters, journal, and the
device half of the API — see [`desktop/agent-host/README.md`](../../desktop/agent-host/README.md).

## What it is for

The Agent Host lets a Lemma workspace run coding agents that live on a user's
own machine: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor. Those agents hold the user's
own credentials and see the user's own files, so they cannot move into the
cloud. The machine reaches Lemma over one outbound WebSocket (see
[The link](#the-link)) and needs no inbound port.

This was originally a CLI feature. The desktop app is now the primary way to
use it, and the CLI is the headless path.

## Who supervises it

**locald, in both connection modes.** It already owns process supervision —
own process group so stopping also stops every ACP adapter, restart backoff,
log rotation — and duplicating that in the shell would risk two `serve`
processes linked to the same backend and claiming the same runs.

| Mode | How locald starts | What it manages |
|---|---|---|
| Local | `ensure_locald`, as today | The whole local stack, plus the Agent Host |
| Hosted | `ensure_locald_without_host_pack` | The Agent Host only |

A hosted workspace has no local stack, so the shell never brought locald up for
it, and a cloud user therefore had no Agent Host at all. The hosted path starts
the same daemon but downloads no runtime artifacts and matches no host-pack
release — with no host pack, locald does nothing but hold its socket and
supervise the sidecar. It is started at launch only when this machine is already
paired and switched on, and otherwise lazily when the workspace page asks, so a
cloud user who never touches the feature never gets a daemon.

## Lifetime

**The Agent Host runs while Lemma is open.** Lemma lives in the tray and can
start at login, so this covers ordinary use with one rule the UI can state
plainly. There is no OS service install at all: Desktop compiles and supervises
the only copy of the sidecar, which is what retired the separate CLI-managed
install and its per-user launchd/systemd/schtasks job. A machine that cannot run
Desktop cannot run an Agent Host.

Full quit stops it through the `desktop.release` handshake — the same hook that
closes an open LAN or public tunnel, because the daemon deliberately outlives
the app and cannot infer either from its own shutdown.

That is the entire lifecycle the user has. **There is no off switch**, and
running is therefore not a preference anyone has to hold: it is a consequence of
the app being open, the way an open window is.

## Connecting is automatic

This computer pairs itself, once per workspace per page load, from
`lemma-frontend/src/desktop/auto-connect.ts`, which is mounted once in the
authenticated shell (`DesktopNotices` in `src/shell/shell.tsx`). The user is never asked to connect and cannot disconnect
the machine they are sitting at — those buttons are gone, along with the
`localStorage` flag that used to referee between them.

The attempt guard is module-level and keyed by workspace origin, not a `useRef`.
Two components on one page call the hook — the shell and the "This Mac" card
on the Models page — and a per-mount guard let both of them mint a pairing code, so one
machine arrived in the workspace twice and the first of the two was orphaned
offline.

The reasoning is worth keeping, because the surface reads as under-built without
it:

- **Connecting was consent that was already implied.** You are signed in, on
  this machine, in an app that supervises the sidecar itself. Pressing a button
  to agree to what you already arranged is ceremony, and it read as *broken* —
  pairing takes a moment and the harness scan takes longer, so pressing it
  looked like nothing, then nothing, then "no agents found".
- **Disconnecting this computer could not be honest.** The next authenticated
  page pairs it straight back, so the button only worked while a flag remembered
  you meant it — and that flag was a sixth state plane, kept per-origin, that
  nothing else in the system could see. Turning the host *off* set the same flag,
  collapsing "pause this laptop" and "never auto-pair me" into one bit.
- **The only real "no" is removing a machine**, and that has a durable home:
  `agent.host.revoke` sets `revoked_at`, ends the runs and commands the host
  held, closes any open link, and the link refuses the host from then on. The
  revoked row is a tombstone for that person and installation: a `pair` for
  it is refused ("This computer was removed from this account…") unless the
  frame carries `reenable: true`, which the app sends only when the person
  presses the card's "Connect again" / "Try again" — never from the automatic
  connection. So removing this computer from another screen sticks against the
  next page load, and turning it back on is a click. The Remove control is
  still hidden on this computer's own card.

Hosted workspaces connect the same way. The gate used to be
`isLocalDeployment()`, which left the cloud user — the one whose laptop and
workspace are genuinely in different places — as the only person still pressing
buttons.

### What pairing does and does not grant

This is what makes an automatic connection safe to have, and it is a property of
the backend rather than of the UI, so it is worth stating where it can be
checked.

**A paired computer belongs to the person who paired it.** `AgentHostModel`
carries a `user_id` and no organization at all. `GET /me/runtime/agent-hosts` is
`/me`-scoped, so nobody else in the workspace can even list the machine.

**Pairing alone dispatches nothing.** A workspace reaches an agent only through a
runtime profile, and `AgentRuntimeProfileService.require_ready_harness` resolves
the host through `get_for_user(host_id, user_id)` — so only the owner can bind
one. Creating that profile is the deliberate act, it defaults to
`RuntimeProfileScope.PERSONAL`, and deleting it is the undo.

So the consent boundary is the profile, not the pairing. Which is why there is
no connect/disconnect: it would be ceremony in front of a step that grants
nothing, standing in for a decision that is made one screen later.

**"Paired" means paired to the workspace on screen, for the person signed
in**, judged from this machine's own `targets`: by origin, by the target's
`user_id` (which the status reports per target), and never a target the host
turned off. Two people who sign in to the app on one Mac are two people, and
the second is paired as themselves rather than inheriting the first one's
pairing. The app also tells the host who is signed in (`agent_host_session`,
locald `agent-host.session`, the hidden CLI `session --url --user`): the
pairings to that Lemma of anybody else are paused (`session_paused` on the
target) — they take no new runs and run no host commands — until their person
signs in again, and signing out pauses them all. The workspace URL the shell
pairs with or reports on is the shell's own, never the page's: in local mode
this installation's loopback API, in hosted mode only the hosted site or its
subdomains over HTTPS (`agent_host_workspace_url` in `desktop/src/agent_host_ui.rs`).
The pairing code reaches the host on stdin (`connect --pairing-code-stdin`),
not on an argument list any process on the Mac can read. Not the backend's host list: the host learns about a
revocation by being *refused*, and it drops the target itself when Lemma refuses
it repeatedly — so the target stops existing and the ordinary "not paired here"
path re-pairs. Repeatedly, because `AGENT_HOST_REVOKED_OR_MISSING` is also what a
host pointed at the wrong backend gets, and one refusal is not enough to destroy
a pairing over.

The one thing that cannot be made silent is macOS's file-access prompt, raised
by an adapter's own binary the first time it probes. Connecting early at least
puts it in front of someone who is still in setup.

Failure is reported rather than hidden. A pairing that cannot complete says so on
the card, with a Try again that clears the attempt guard — the guard exists so a
machine that cannot pair does not mint pairing codes in a loop, not to refuse
someone who asked.

## The three status planes

These do not always agree, and the difference is the whole point. They are an
internal distinction: the UI ranks them into a single reported state.

| Plane | Source | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| Process | locald's supervisor | Is the sidecar installed, and is it alive? |
| Connection | the host's own journal, via the sidecar's `status --json` | Is it paired, is it reaching the workspace, what work does it hold? |
| Cloud | `GET /me/runtime/agent-hosts` | Did the backend hear a heartbeat in the last 90s, and what harnesses were published? |

**The UI reports reachability, not liveness.** A running host that is unpaired,
or whose connection is down, is a live process that will never pick up a run;
reporting it as simply "on" is a lie the user discovers only when nothing
happens. So both the tray and the "This computer" card rank the planes. The card
ranks them, in `describeThisComputer` (`lemma-frontend/src/desktop/this-computer.ts`):

not available → connecting → starting → connected → unreachable → reconnecting

with "couldn't connect" displacing *connecting*, and the tray adds "not starting"
for a sidecar whose spawn failed. Connecting comes before starting because the
card asks the more specific question first: a machine with no pairing for *this*
workspace is not connected to it whatever the process is doing.

Every one of those is a report, never a prompt. "Off" used to sit in that
ranking and was the only rung that needed a user to act; with the switch gone,
"installed but not running" and "running but not paired here" are both stages of
a connection on its way up, and they say so.

**A stage a thing cannot leave is a failure wearing its clothes.** Three of these
were introduced without one — an adapter whose install failed still said
"Setting up", a sidecar that could not spawn still said "starting", a pairing
that threw still said "Connecting" — and each was indistinguishable from progress
for as long as the app stayed open. Every optimistic state on this surface owes
the reader a way to stop being optimistic.

So the two stages on the way up have an end. *Starting* becomes **Not
running**, with **Restart** (`agent_host_start`, which also forgives the
crashes that made the supervisor stop trying), after 30 seconds.
*Connecting* becomes **Not connected**, with **Connect again**, after 30
seconds: the automatic connection is one attempt per page, so a pairing the
host dropped mid-session is otherwise never retried. "Connect again" is a
person's click, so it sends `reenable`. A pairing the workspace refused as too
old (close 4426, "this Lemma needs a newer Agent Host") reads **Update
needed**, with **Check for updates**, as does a build with no sidecar at all.
The card never shows the shell's or the sidecar's error text; that is what
**Open log** is for.

A coding agent that needs signing in or updating on *this* computer names the
command to type and offers **Check again**, which is `agent_host_refresh`: the
host re-probes and republishes now instead of on its own 15-minute cycle.
Settings → This Mac → Coding agents lists what was found, with each agent's
release and its update command.

locald merges the process and connection planes into `agent-host.status` and the
`agent_host` key of `control.snapshot`, caching the journal read for two seconds
so a polling page cannot fork the sidecar on every tick.

`targets[].host_id` is the join key between the local planes and the cloud one:
it is the same id `/me/runtime/agent-hosts` returns. That is how the workspace
page recognises which paired computer is the one you are sitting at, without a
new endpoint.

## Surfaces

| Surface | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace → Settings → Models | local, hosted, and plain browser | The canonical surface. "This Mac"/"This PC" card (`lemma-frontend/src/desktop/this-computer-card.tsx`) in the desktop app; cloud-only view and "Get the app" elsewhere |
| Workspace → Settings → This Mac → Coding agents | local, in the app's own window | The same card, the agents it found with their releases and update commands, and "Run commands on this Mac" (off-limits until this computer's own pairing exists) |
| Tray | desktop | Glanceable state and the log, without opening a window |
| Local settings → This computer | desktop | Status row in the card's words, Restart, log, and a button that opens Coding agents (Models, in a hosted workspace) — recovery when the workspace itself will not load |

Local settings is local-mode only, so it must not be the canonical surface;
choosing which agents this workspace may use lives in the workspace page, where a
cloud user can reach it too. That choice is now the *only* decision on the page —
everything else about this computer connects itself and reports.

The tray line is a disabled label. Its "Turn Agent Host On/Off" item went with
the switch, which also removed the mirrored `running` flag on `Shell::ui` that
existed only to tell the toggle which way to point.

## The privilege boundary

The workspace page is a **remote origin** to Tauri — locald serves it over
http, and the hosted build loads `lemma.work` — so it can only reach the shell
through a capability naming its URL. `capabilities/workspace.json` grants
`open_control_center`, seven `agent_host_*` commands, `sandbox_image_status`,
the conversation-folder commands, `discover_provider_models` and
`configure_ai_provider` — and, for Settings → This Mac, the commands that
change this computer's own settings: `local_settings_snapshot`,
`apply_local_settings`, `test_server_setup`, `local_sharing`, `set_start_at_login`,
`set_host_execution`, `repair_runtime`, `open_logs`, `diagnostic_logs`, `prepare_sandbox_image`,
`check_for_app_update`, `install_app_update`, `telemetry_status` and
`set_telemetry_enabled`. Nothing destructive is granted: resetting data,
reinstalling and restarting into recovery stay in Local settings.

The Agent Host commands check `require_agent_host_caller`: the hosted site
this app navigated to in hosted mode, and in local mode only the shipped
loopback workspace origin -- while sharing is on, the origin this app
navigated to is the shared LAN or tunnel address, which is refused. The This
Mac commands carry the narrower `require_local_settings_caller`: local mode,
the `main` webview, the origin this app navigated to, and that origin one of
the shipped loopback workspace hosts. The capability also lists `https://lemma.work`, and that check is what
keeps a hosted page from reaching an installation it is not. Public sharing,
repair and installing an update each raise a native confirmation from Rust
before acting, so the page asking is never the person agreeing.
[Desktop architecture](desktop.md#tauri-ipc-commands-and-who-may-call-them)
has the full table.

None of these checks asks who is signed in. There is no installation owner and
no privileged account: the boundary is the app's own window on this
installation's loopback origin, which only the person at this Mac can drive.
Anything account-scoped beyond that -- which user's runs this Agent Host
serves -- follows the pairing, not the order accounts were created in.

Note what those five *cannot* do. `agent_host_start` has no counterpart, and
`agent_host_unpair` is gone: the workspace can ask this computer to be running,
to pair, and to look for agents again — never the reverse. A remote off switch
and an automatic connection would have spent their lives undoing each other, and
the grant is narrower for not having both.

This is why the Agent Host commands cannot sit behind `require_control_window`:
that guard is what blocks a remote origin in the first place.
`require_agent_host_caller` replaces it, accepting Local settings as a trusted
bundled page, or the main webview while it is on the origin this app actually
navigated to.

Sharing republishes the same workspace on a LAN address or tunnel host. Those
are different origins, are deliberately absent from the capability, and fail the
Rust-side check too — a visitor's browser can drive the shared Lemma, but never
this Mac's Agent Host. The app's own window moves to the shared origin while
sharing is on, so it loses the This Mac settings too; the menu's Desktop
settings… opens Local settings then, which is where sharing is turned off.

Because the app declares an ACL manifest (`desktop/build.rs`), *every* app
command now needs an explicit grant, including from the bundled pages. Adding a
command without adding it to a capability makes every call to it fail at
runtime, which is why `desktop/src/main.rs` tests that every registered command
is granted somewhere.

## Pairing

Pairing is no clicks: the page mints a code through the session it already has
open and hands it straight to the bundled sidecar over `agent-host.pair`.
Nothing is displayed and nothing is copied.

The pairing it looks for is **this workspace's**, not any pairing at all. A Mac
paired to its own local stack and then opened against a hosted workspace needs a
second one, and `status.paired` — "paired to something" — said it was already
done. `selectWorkspaceTarget` answers the narrower question, and both the card
and the automatic connection go through it so they cannot disagree.

A *different* machine pairs the same way — install Desktop there and sign in —
so there is no code to carry and no copyable command to get wrong. Failures are
still reported with the pairing code stripped: the host quotes its argument list
back on error, and one of those arguments is a live single-use credential.

## The lifecycles underneath

Seven of them sit between typing in a chat and Claude Code answering, and no one
component owns the composition. They are genuinely different concerns with
different failure modes, so they are not going to collapse into one — but the
bugs live between them, which is why they present to a user as "it's slow" or
"it's stuck" rather than as anything nameable.

| Lifecycle | Owner | Keyed on | Ends when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Host process | locald supervisor | data directory | app quits |
| Pairing | host config `targets[]` | workspace origin | revoked |
| Adapter cache | `adapters.rs` | adapter key + version | never (verified per launch) |
| Harness discovery | `runtime.rs` refresh loop | `refresh_generation` | republished on change |
| Runtime profile | backend | harness id + org | archived |
| Run | backend dispatch + host journal | run id | terminal state |
| ACP session | `acp.rs` | conversation + provider session id | session is removed or its harness changes |

Immediately after ACP opens or loads a session, Agent Host journals a
`run_state` event containing its provider session id before dispatching the
prompt. The backend consumes that event in stream order and commits the
conversation metadata binding before processing answer events. Follow-up turns
load that same session in the conversation's persistent working directory.
Control checkpoints retain the binding for older hosts and recovery, but a late
checkpoint from an older run cannot replace a newer run's session. Changing to
a different provider session clears the old session's instruction-delivery
digest; instructions are acknowledged only after a prompt has landed.

The session binding also records `host_id` and `host_cwd`, reported by the
leased host at session establishment. `host_cwd` is the exact directory passed
to ACP for native tools; it is an observation, not a permission grant. The
existing top-level conversation `cwd` still selects the sandbox directory for
Lemma MCP execution tools. These filesystems have no implicit mount or sync.
Agent Host supplies the native cwd in the prompt, and follow-up checkpoints
without that field preserve it for the same provider session. Conversation
directories are retained across turns and idle periods; starting another run
does not delete older conversations' files.

What has to stay true across them:

**One derived answer crosses the seam.** What leaves the subsystem is a single
value — can this computer take work right now, and if not, why — mapped from the
internal states exhaustively. The ranking above is that mapping.

**The host is the sole author of its own readiness.** It is the only component
that can observe the truth; the backend and the shell cache what it last said.
The backend may report that it has not heard from a host recently — a fact about
the cache, not about the host — but it may not compose a status of its own. The
shell adds exactly one thing the host cannot say about itself: the process is not
running. Three components answering the same question, with a UI ranking their
answers, is the arrangement that produced a card reporting a dead local stack as
a live workspace's status.

**The host models transport, never conversation.** Its run states describe what
happened to a dispatch. `RunState::WaitingInput` is the one exception and should
not be: nothing in the host authors it, it sits in the terminal set *and* carries
a hand-written exemption out of it, and the conversation layer already derives
the same fact from the event stream. Removing it needs a migration, because it is
persisted on both sides.

**Every state variant has a producer.** `HarnessHealth::Installing` had UI copy
written for it and was emitted by nothing for as long as installing finished
before anything could look. `HostStatus::Revoked` is unreachable on the link
because authentication fails before a `welcome` exists — the host learns it
from close code 4401 instead. Nothing fails when a variant has no producer; it just quietly
never happens.

**A remedy named in an error must be reachable by the person reading it.** A
corrupt adapter cache says `run doctor --repair`, and Desktop exposes no doctor
surface — so the advice is a dead end for every user who can receive it.

## What a coding agent loads

Lemma is the source of truth for what a run's agent is told and can use: its
instructions, its skills (through `lemma_load_skill`) and its tools (Lemma's
MCP server). A coding agent on somebody's Mac also loads its own -- Claude
Code reads `~/.claude`, Codex `~/.codex` and `~/.agents`, OpenCode those and
`~/.config/opencode` -- and left alone they compete with Lemma's: an older
copy of Lemma's own `browser` skill, a hook that rewrites every command, a
plugin that drives the person's own Chrome, a tessl-managed `AGENTS.md` that
sends the agent off to read `../.tessl/RULES.md`. So by default each run
starts its agent with the agent's own switches set to leave out what they
can, and each agent can be given its own setup back.

Claude Code's switches reach everything, and its sign-in is tied to its
folder, so it keeps its folder and leaves the rest out by flag
(`desktop/agent-host/src/acp/session_options.rs`, with the sign-in carried
over by `desktop/agent-host/src/acp/claude_settings.rs`). Codex and OpenCode
run in the person's own config folders: their `~/.codex` and
`~/.config/opencode` -- `AGENTS.md`, skills, hooks, rules, MCP servers -- load
unchanged, as in the person's terminal. Lemma adds only its MCP server, its
`LEMMA_*` environment and its instructions, and turns off an agent's own web
search or fetch when the run has Lemma's.

A bound project's own files -- its `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, its `.claude/`,
`.codex/` or `.opencode/` -- belong to the folder the person chose and load in
either mode.

| Agent | How | Left out | Still loaded |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `session/new` and `session/load` `_meta`, read by `claude-agent-acp`: `claudeCode.options` `settingSources: ["project", "local"]`, `strictMcpConfig`, `plugins: []`, `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY`, and `settings` (flag settings) carrying only the sign-in keys of `~/.claude/settings.json` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, skills, agents, commands, output styles, plugins, hooks and settings; the person's MCP servers (`~/.claude.json`) and claude.ai connectors; auto-memory | the sign-in (keychain or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`), and `apiKeyHelper`, `awsAuthRefresh`, `awsCredentialExport`, `gcpAuthRefresh`, `forceLoginMethod`, `forceLoginOrgUUID` and the provider variables of `env` (`ANTHROPIC_*`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*`, `AWS_*`, `GOOGLE_*`, proxies) from its settings; Claude Code's bundled skills; `claude-agent-acp` itself still reads `~/.claude/settings.json` for `permissions.defaultMode`, `availableModels` and `modelOverrides` |
| Codex | nothing: the person's own `CODEX_HOME` and setup, unchanged. The only override is `web_search: "disabled"` in `CODEX_CONFIG` (merged into the pinned adapter's value) when the run has Lemma's own web search, so the agent does not hold two | -- (Codex's own web search, only when Lemma's is there) | everything: the sign-in, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, skills, hooks, `rules/`, the person's MCP servers and the rest of `config.toml`; Lemma's MCP server and instructions on top |
| OpenCode | nothing: the person's own setup, unchanged. The only override is `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` `{"permission": {"webfetch": "deny"}}` when the run has Lemma's own page fetch | -- (OpenCode's own `webfetch`, only when Lemma's is there) | everything: `~/.config/opencode` (`AGENTS.md`, skills, `opencode.json`'s MCP servers), and the skills it borrows from `~/.claude` and `~/.agents`; Lemma's MCP server and instructions on top |
| Cursor | nothing | -- | everything (`~/.cursor/cli-config.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, the account's user rules). `cursor-agent` documents one knob, `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR`, which moves `cli-config.json` and reportedly the sign-in with it; it offers no switch for rules or MCP servers that spares the login, and until one is verified against a signed-in `cursor-agent` Cursor is left as it is |

**"Use my own skills and settings"** (Claude Code only, off by default,
under Settings → This Mac → Coding agents and beside this computer's Claude
Code on Models) puts `~/.claude` back -- Claude Code with its own settings. It
is not drawn for other agents and has no effect on them: the
set of such agents is `own_settings` in the Agent Host's `config.json`,
changed by `lemma-agent-host own-settings enable|disable <agent>`, locald's
`agent-host.own-settings` and the Tauri command `agent_host_own_settings`,
reported as `own_settings` in `agent-host.status`, and read by each run as it
starts.

Lemma's own tools stay in reach in either mode: Lemma's MCP server is named in
every session (and is the only one Claude Code loads), the run's `LEMMA_*`
sign-in is in every agent's environment, and Lemma's `lemma` CLI goes first
on its `PATH` (below). `desktop/agent-host/tests/acp_session_options_e2e.rs`
holds the host to all of it for every agent;
`desktop/scripts/check_agent_isolation.py` (local, not CI) runs the real
`claude` in a fake home to check the upstream behaviour this relies on.

Answering what a person owes works the same as in-process: an Agent Host
run is served `respond_to_notification` and `submit_workflow_form` over MCP
(the in-process harness gets them from its open-notifications capability),
and what is still open rides in the turn's prompt rather than the system
prompt, which a provider session keeps from its first turn. With host
execution on, the runtime prompt names the release's own `lemma` CLI, which
the host puts first on the agent's `PATH` (`WORKSPACE_HOST_CLI_ROOT`).

Some things apply either way, because Lemma offers the same and its prompt
tells the agent to use Lemma's:

- **Instructions.** Claude Code is given Lemma's in `_meta.systemPrompt.append`
  -- appended to its own system prompt, on every run, since every run starts
  the adapter afresh -- and no longer as a `<system>` block opening the
  prompt, where they read as the person's own words. The other agents still
  receive the block on the turns `system_prompt_delivery` says need it.
- **The browser.** Claude Code's browser integration is off
  (`disallowedTools: ["mcp__claude-in-chrome"]`, `--no-chrome`): the browser
  the person watches is Lemma's. `AskUserQuestion` stays off too, as the
  adapter already makes it; Lemma asks through `lemma_ask_user`.
- **The web.** When the run has `lemma_web_search`, Claude Code's `WebSearch`
  and Codex's web search (`web_search: "disabled"`) are off; when it has
  `lemma_web_fetch`, Claude Code's `WebFetch` and OpenCode's `webfetch`.
- **`lemma`.** When the backend ships a CLI beside it (`lemma_cli` in the run's
  MCP configuration, from `WORKSPACE_HOST_CLI_ROOT`; Desktop's host pack sets
  it), its `bin/` goes first on the agent's `PATH`, so the `lemma` an agent's
  shell runs is the release its server is, signed in as the run through the
  `LEMMA_*` environment (with `LEMMA_CONVERSATION_ID`). The host accepts the
  folder by the rule host execution uses
  ([§6](desktop-host-execution.md#6-the-seatbelt-profile)).

`desktop/agent-host/tests/acp_session_options_e2e.rs` holds the driver to
delivering each of these, against a scripted agent that records what it is
sent and the environment it starts in.

## The link

The host talks to Lemma over **one WebSocket per paired workspace**, opened by
the host to `wss://<api>/agent-host/link`. It is still outbound only, so the
machine needs no inbound port. Everything travels on it: commands down, events,
checkpoints and harnesses up, and the Lemma MCP tool calls the agent makes.
There is no HTTP API for the host any more.

It replaced a 25-second HTTP long-poll plus one POST per streamed event. The
poll was cheap: about 2.4 requests a minute, woken early by a Redis poke. The
event uploads were not. While an agent streamed, every chunk, tool update and
usage report was its own authenticated POST: roughly 1,200 to 3,600 a minute
against a local backend and 400 to 750 over the internet. Each cost a database
session, a host-secret hash lookup and a Redis script. The link authenticates
once, subscribes to the host's wake-up channel once, and pushes in both
directions the moment there is something to say. A cancel no longer waits for
the next poll, and a checkpoint no longer waits for the current one to return.

### Frames

Every frame is a JSON text message:

```json
{ "type": "events", "id": "17", "body": { … } }
{ "type": "events_ok", "re": "17", "body": { … } }
```

`id` names a request that expects an answer. `re` on the answer points back at
it. Pushes carry neither. The frames are defined once in
`desktop/agent-host/src/link/protocol.rs` and once in
`lemma-backend/app/modules/agent/domain/agent_host_link.py`, and both are held
to `desktop/agent-host/tests/fixtures/wire_contract.json`.

| Direction | `type` | Body | Answered by |

`op` is the one request Lemma makes of the host: a host-execution operation,
answered with `re` set to its `id`. Lemma's ids and the host's are separate
namespaces; each side matches `re` only against requests it sent. The host
runs each `op` in a task of its own, at most `MAX_CONCURRENT_OPS` (32) at once,
so a `process.read` long-waiting for output never holds up the reader, the
heartbeat, or another op. An op with no answer by its `deadline_ms` is answered
`timeout` by the host itself. A link opened without host execution (pairing,
revocation, a platform without Seatbelt) answers every `op` with
`exec_server_unavailable`. The methods, parameters and failure kinds are in
[Host execution on Desktop](desktop-host-execution.md#4-the-op-frames).

`host_execution` is `{enabled, platform, available}`: whether the machine's user turned
host execution on, `macos`/`linux`/`windows`, and whether this machine can
confine commands (macOS with `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`). Only the pairing with
the Lemma installed on this computer -- plain HTTP to loopback, the one
pairing that may use it (`TargetConfig::is_local_install`) -- has an op
handler or ever reports `enabled`; every other pairing (a hosted workspace, a
teammate's shared install) answers `op` as a host without host execution, and
the switch is that local pairing's own (`host_execution` on the target in
`config.json`). It rides on every
`control` as well as `hello`, so turning it on or off reaches Lemma within
seconds without a reconnect. Lemma routes a run of the host's paired user to it only when
both booleans are true.

The first frame on a connection is `pair` (no `Authorization` header) or
`hello` (with `Authorization: Bearer <host secret>`). Anything else first is a
protocol violation.

### Close codes

| Code | Meaning | Host does |
|---|---|---|
| 1000 | done: after `paired` or `revoked` | nothing further |
| 1012 | Lemma is restarting (after `reconnect`) | reconnects after `after_ms` |
| 4400 | protocol violation | reconnects with backoff, and logs it |
| 4401 | `AGENT_HOST_REVOKED_OR_MISSING` | counts toward dropping the pairing (three in a row) |
| 4403 | malformed or missing credential; also a refused `pair` (`installation_revoked` for a removed computer) | reconnects with backoff, never disables the pairing |
| 4408 | no frame from the host for `heartbeat_ms × 3` | reconnects |
| 4409 | superseded by a newer connection for this host | stops this connection. A link that lasted a minute or more was a hand-over and is reopened at once; one superseded sooner is another host holding the same credential, so each consecutive one waits longer (0.5 s doubling to 5 minutes) instead of taking the link back for ever |
| 4426 | the host's protocol is too old | reports `upgrade required` and stops; Desktop's updater takes over |

### Heartbeat and liveness

The host sends a `control` frame at least every `heartbeat_ms` (20 seconds)
and immediately whenever it has something new to report: an acknowledgement, a
checkpoint or a rejection. `control` is the heartbeat, for the same reason the
poll was. It carries the non-terminal checkpoint of every run in flight, and
that checkpoint is what renews the run's 90-second lease. 20 seconds keeps the
lease renewed four times over, and keeps the socket well inside Cloudflare's
100-second idle limit.

### Delivery

Nothing here is new durability. The link moved the transport and kept every
guarantee:

- **Commands** stay in Postgres and are handed out with `FOR UPDATE SKIP
  LOCKED`. Any API replica holding a host's socket can push them, so there is no
  routing table and no sticky session. A replica pushes when it is poked on the
  host's channel, when it applies a `control` frame, and every 5 seconds as the
  floor for a lost poke. The host de-duplicates by `command_id`
  (`command_receipts`) and acknowledges on its next `control`.
- **Events** keep their per-run `sequence`. The host keeps them in its SQLite
  outbox until `events_ok` acknowledges them, and replays from there after a
  reconnect. Lemma's stream de-duplicates by sequence. Delivery drains: one
  pass reads at most 1,024 events, and a pass that was cut off, or that
  rewound a refused run for replay, is followed by another without waiting for
  a new event. Connecting kicks delivery once, so a run that finished while
  the host was offline is delivered in full, terminal event included.
- **Control updates** are idempotent and stale ones are ignored.
  `control_ok.refused` names any update Lemma could not parse, and it is the
  only way one is refused. Lemma applies each update separately, so one bad
  update never blocks the rest. The host's old bisection of a refused poll is
  gone with the poll.
- **The guarantee is tested by breaking it.** `test_agent_host_chaos_e2e.py`
  kills the backend and closes the link while a batch is appended but not yet
  acknowledged, and kills the host mid-turn. Every run is held to contiguous
  sequences, one terminal event, one persisted answer and one provider prompt.
- **MCP tool calls** are re-authorized on every call against the run's own
  token, exactly as the HTTP endpoint did, and a `run_id` they name must be a
  run of the `conversation_id` they name, or the call is `UNAUTHORIZED`.
- **A tool call executes at most once.** The host mints a `request_id`
  (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`) for each `tools/call` and sends the same one on
  every retry of that call, on any link. Lemma claims `(run_id, request_id)` in
  Redis (`SET NX`); the first arrival executes the call in a task the link does
  not own, so a socket that drops mid-call does not cancel it, and its outcome
  -- the MCP result, or the failure -- is kept for an hour. A duplicate that
  arrives while it runs waits for that outcome; one that arrives after is
  answered from it. Nothing is executed twice
  (`agent_host_link_tool_calls.py`). `welcome` says so with
  `idempotent_tool_calls: true`, and a host resends a `tools/call` after a drop
  only to a server that said it. A call without a `request_id`, from an older
  host, runs as it arrives and goes with its link.
- **Only a refusal before dispatch is retryable.** Authorizing the call and
  taking its claim can fail with `retryable: true` (an auth lookup that could
  not answer, a full link). Once the call is dispatched, every failure is
  `retryable: false`, `INTERNAL` and `UNAVAILABLE` included: the tool may
  already have acted.
- **Parked interactions.** A parked `ask_user` is waited on with
  `interaction_wait`, which Lemma answers when the person decides. Waits have
  their own slots on the link, apart from tool calls, so a queue of questions
  never stalls the runs still working. A wait whose run has ended is answered
  `TERMINAL_RUN`, not held for its full half hour. The bridge no longer polls
  every 2 seconds.
- **Steering.** A message the person sends while a run is working reaches a
  harness that published the `steering` capability as a `STEER_RUN` command,
  fenced on the run's lease epoch like every run command. The run's turn sends
  it to the agent with ACP's `_session/steering` extension and reports a
  `steer_result` event; see
  [Steering](agent-host-events.md#steering). Nothing about it is required for
  correctness: a lost command or result leaves the message queued in Lemma, and
  the follow-up turn delivers it when the current one ends.
- **The host's MCP relay** (`mcp_relay.rs`) is a loopback port every account
  on the Mac can reach, so a connection must present the relay token on its
  first line within 5 seconds and in at most 64 KiB, later lines are bounded
  at 8 MiB without being read whole first, and at most 64 connections are
  held. It serves only runs the journal says are still going, and ends a
  parked wait itself when its run does. An answer too large for the bridge
  goes as an error saying so, not as a line the bridge would hang up on. The
  bridge (`mcp_bridge`) sends the token first on each connection, marks a
  connection gone the moment its reader ends -- a request never waits on a
  relay that already hung up -- waits out an endpoint file left by a relay
  that has restarted, passes an agent's `notifications/cancelled` on to the
  relay as a `cancel`, and gives up on a listing after 2 minutes and a call
  after 30.
- **Clock skew.** `welcome` carries `server_time` (UTC). Command expiry is
  stamped by Lemma's clock, so the host corrects by the difference rather than
  refusing every command when its own clock is off, and judges a run's
  deadline the same way. A `CANCEL_RUN` is never refused as expired: stopping
  late is still stopping.
- **Sleep.** A Mac that sleeps stops the heartbeat a run's lease hangs on, and
  the run is given up once the lease and its recovery grace pass. While any
  run holds a slot the host keeps the Mac awake with `caffeinate -i -s -w
  <host pid>` (`runtime/awake.rs`), released when the last run ends and gone
  with the host if it dies. `-s` covers a closed lid on power; on battery with
  the lid closed macOS sleeps regardless.
- **Removing a computer sticks, and ends its work.** Revoking sets
  `revoked_at` and, in the same transaction, fails every unfinished run lease
  on the host with `HOST_REVOKED` (the run ends with that sentence) and cancels
  its queued and delivered commands; nothing waits for a machine that can no
  longer connect. The row stays as a tombstone: a `pair` for that user and
  installation is refused with `installation_revoked` ("This computer was
  removed from this account. Connect it again from Lemma to turn it back on.")
  and the code is left unused, so the host's automatic connection cannot undo
  a removal. Only a `pair` with `reenable: true`, sent when the person asks
  from the app, brings it back.

**A connection closes with its last owner.** The socket's reader and writer
tasks belong to the handles that talk on it: when the last handle is dropped
-- a refused handshake, a session abandoned after a timed-out request -- the
writer sends a close frame and both tasks end, bounded by a two-second grace.
The worker also closes a lost session's link explicitly, so a request still
waiting on it fails at once and retries on the next link.

**Newest connection wins.** A host that reconnects after a network drop can
leave a half-open socket behind on some replica. Every accepted `hello` claims
the host's next `link_generation` in the database, in the transaction that
authenticates it, so handshakes racing on two replicas come away ordered. Once
subscribed to the host's channel, the connection reads the current generation
and closes with 4409 if it is already greater than its own; otherwise it
publishes a `superseded` notice carrying its generation, and every connection
holding a smaller one closes with 4409. Commands therefore go out on one socket
at a time.

The generation decides, not which notice arrived. When "newer" meant "any other
connection id", two handshakes that both subscribed before either announced
each heard the other and both closed. The read after subscribing covers the
opposite order: a newer `hello` whose notice went out before this connection
was listening has already claimed its generation, so the read sees it.

**Draining.** An API replica that is shutting down sends `reconnect` with a
random `after_ms` of up to 5 seconds and closes with 1012, so a deploy does not
reconnect every host at the same instant.

### Timing

Two clocks decide how long "install an agent, use it in a chat" takes:

- `DISK_SCAN_INTERVAL`: how often the supervisor asks whether the agents on this
  machine changed. It is affordable because detection is a handful of `stat`
  calls, not a probe.
- `heartbeat_ms`: the longest the host goes without telling Lemma it is alive.

`HARNESS_REFRESH_INTERVAL` is the safety net behind the scan, not the mechanism.

There is no longer a clock hiding inside the transport. With the poll, anything
the worker loop had to do sooner than 25 seconds needed its own arm in the
`select!`, because the loop spent nearly all of its time waiting on a held
request. The link's reader, writer and worker are separate tasks joined by
channels, so work happens when it is due.

### Retired HTTP routes

Desktop 0.8.0 and earlier run a protocol-2 host, which speaks HTTP and never
opens the link, so it cannot be sent 4426. Its old routes answer with the one
refusal it already understands and serve nothing else
(`agent_host_legacy_controller.py`):

- `POST /agent-host/poll` returns 200 with a poll response naming protocol 3.
  The old host fails the poll on the version, shows the computer offline with
  "target requested Agent Host protocol 3 is unsupported", and retries every
  30 seconds. It keeps its pairing, so updating Desktop is all it takes to
  reconnect. The first such poll marks the host `UPGRADE_REQUIRED`, which the
  workspace shows as "Update needed", and logs
  `agent.agent_host_legacy.upgrade_required` once.
- Pairing, event upload, harness publication, self-revocation, and the
  `/agent-runtime/conversations/...` MCP mount return
  `410 {"detail": {"code": "AGENT_HOST_UPGRADE_REQUIRED", ...}}`. The old host
  treats that as a request rejection and stops instead of retrying. A person
  pairing an old app sees the message.

A `401 AGENT_HOST_REVOKED_OR_MISSING` would stop the old host faster, but it
drops its pairing after three refusals, and the person would have to pair again
after updating.

**Removal.** Delete the controller, its `/agent-runtime/conversations/` entry in
`EXCLUDED_PATHS`, and this section no earlier than 2027-03-25 (six months after
protocol 3 shipped on 2026-09-25), and only after
`agent.agent_host_legacy.upgrade_required` has not been logged for 30 days.

# Testing strategy

Lemma has three kinds of test, and they answer three different questions. Most
arguments about testing here are really arguments about which question is being
asked, so start there.

| Suite | The question it answers | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit** | Is this unit correct? | `lemma-backend/app/**/tests/unit/` |
| **Module e2e** | Does this module's HTTP surface behave — including when the things it depends on fail? | `lemma-backend/app/modules/*/tests/e2e/` |
| **Product scenarios** | Does Lemma keep its promises to a person, over a real socket? | `tests/scenarios/` |

A test that answers none of the three is the only kind that should simply be
deleted.

---

## Which one am I writing?

**Is it a promise the product makes to somebody using it?** Then it is a
scenario. It belongs in `tests/scenarios/`, it names a `PS-` id from
[the product specification](product/README.md), and the specification moves to
`covered` in the same pull request — after you have watched it pass.

**Is it about what happens when something fails?** A provider times out, storage
returns 503, a write races another write. Then it is a module e2e test.
Scenarios cannot reach those paths: the suite forbids mocking, and there is no
way to make a real dependency fail on demand. This is the module suites' most
valuable work and it is not replaceable.

**Is it about one function, one class, one rule?** Then it is a unit test. It
should not need Postgres.

The common mistake is writing a scenario for something that is not a promise —
a helper's edge case, a serializer's shape. Those pass, they cost minutes of
stack time, and they say nothing anybody outside the team would recognise.

---

## Why the scenario suite is shaped the way it is

Two properties are worth understanding before adding to it, because they explain
rules that otherwise look like dogma.

**It goes over a real socket, and the module e2e suite does not.** Module e2e
tests use `httpx.ASGITransport`, which hands a request straight to the
application object. That is fast, and it means those tests **never run the
application's lifespan** — the fixture's own docstring says so. Everything in
`app.py::lifespan` and every module's `api_lifespans` — the thread pool, the
connection-scope monitor, analytics, SuperTokens, the job queue, the message bus
— is dark to them. A green module-e2e run does not imply a bootable system.
Scenarios boot one.

The same goes for the wire itself: body-size limits that deliberately do not
trust `Content-Length`, header limits, chunked encoding, a real WebSocket
handshake. None of it is exercised in-process.

**It is traced to a specification that can fail.** `docs/product/` states what
the product is *meant* to do, not what the code does. When the two disagree the
default assumption is that the code is wrong. That is what makes a `gap` status
meaningful, and it is why the rule in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) exists: if the system does not behave the
way a scenario says, do not edit the scenario.

## The lanes, and what runs when

| Lane | Command | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| Backend unit | `make test-backend-unit` | Every push that touches the backend, via `e2e.yml`. **Required**, through `Backend E2E passed`. |
| Backend e2e | `make test-e2e-fast` | Every push that touches the backend, via `e2e.yml`. **Required**, as one aggregated check. |
| Backend + Agent Host | `make desktop-agent-host-e2e` | Backend, frontend, TypeScript SDK or desktop changes, in Desktop contracts CI. **Required.** Builds the Rust host and checks real HTTP streaming and disconnect recovery with a scripted provider, host execution under Seatbelt (macOS only), and chaos: the backend killed, the host killed and the link dropped mid-answer, each run still ending once with every event delivered once. |
| Chat + Agent Host | `make desktop-agent-host-browser-e2e` | Same required job. Real web chat, streaming, Stop, concurrent approvals, tool approval/denial, provider failure, disconnect, and transcript reload driven by JSON ACP fixtures; no provider account. |
| Desktop launch smoke | `desktop/e2e/launch_smoke.py` | Desktop, frontend, TypeScript SDK or backend agent-module changes, as CI's `Desktop launch smoke` on macOS. Not yet in `CI passed`. Builds the debug app, launches it in hosted mode against this checkout's stack, and walks sign-up, pairing, one Agent Host conversation and This Mac's status. No VM: local mode is not covered. The script's docstring lists what it proves and skips. |
| Scenario gates | `make scenarios-guards`, `make scenario-coverage` | Every pull request |
| Scenarios (fast) | `make scenarios` | Nightly, on request, or with the `run-scenarios` label |
| Scenarios (all local lanes) | `make scenarios-all` | Locally; runs non-live journeys, sandbox cases and client conformance, then writes one report |
| Scenarios (sandbox) | `make scenarios-sandbox` | Same, after building the workspace images |
| Scenarios (live) | `make scenarios-live` | Locally, before a release. See [LIVE.md](../tests/scenarios/LIVE.md) |
| Protected e2e | `make test-e2e-runtime` | Weekly and on every `v*` tag, via `backend-protected-e2e.yml`. Where `@pytest.mark.slow` tests go, and what every Desktop release gate reads. It builds nothing, so a test needing a compiled artifact belongs in the lane that builds it. |
| Sandbox function benchmark | `make benchmark-functions-docker` | Nightly on Docker, weekly on E2B, via `sandbox-function-benchmark.yml`. Owns `@pytest.mark.benchmark`: wall-clock budgets are trended here and gate nothing. |
| Real-LLM e2e | `make test-e2e-real-llm` | Locally whenever a change touches the model or pause path. Not in CI. |

The real-LLM lane is worth one paragraph, because its absence used to be
invisible. Every `@pytest.mark.real_llm` test ran in **no** lane at all: the
pull-request lane uses the deterministic model, and the weekly protected lane
sets `E2E_REAL=1` *together with* `E2E_LLM_MODE=mock` — and `conftest.py` reads
the explicit mode first, so they skipped there too. A test that runs nowhere
still looks like coverage in a listing.

It runs locally only. There was a `workflow_dispatch` workflow for it, and in
its whole life nobody dispatched it once — a lane that costs money per run and
needs a person to decide to spend it does not get used by being available. The
live scenario and E2B conformance crons went with it for a nearer reason: they
ran on a schedule against credentials this deployment does not hold, so they
reported green having executed nothing (`8 skipped in 84.85s`), which is worse
than not running at all, because a listing counts them.

None of the tests were deleted. `make test-e2e-real-llm`, `make scenarios-live`,
and the E2B conformance files are all still here and still run on a machine that
holds the credentials. What is gone is the pretence that CI was running them.

Nothing in CI should reach a real provider anyway: this repository is public, so
a fork must never be able to reach a credential, which is why none of these ever
ran on `pull_request`. Their results also deliberately never fed
`e2e-union.json` — a coverage floor has to be reproducible from a pull request,
and a number that moved because somebody spent money on a manual run is not.

### What may run in front of the merge button

A pull request waits for the backend e2e lane, so a test in it spends every
reviewer's time, every time. There is a budget: **45 seconds per test**,
enforced per shard by `scripts/e2e_durations.py --check` against
`.github/e2e-slow-baseline.json`.

Over the budget, there are three honest answers and one dishonest one:

- **Mark it `@pytest.mark.slow`.** It moves to the scheduled protected lane.
  Right when the thing under test is a matrix of variations rather than a
  contract that can break on its own. Two things do not belong there whatever
  they cost: a test needing something compiled — the protected lane installs no
  toolchain and builds nothing — and a wall-clock budget, which is
  `@pytest.mark.benchmark` and belongs to the lane that trends it. Every Desktop
  release waits on that lane, so a red there has to mean a defect.
- **Split it.** Keep a cheap test that proves the wiring is connected, and
  move the exhaustive half to `slow`. This is usually the best answer:
  `test_kreuzberg_upload_indexes_a_document_and_makes_it_searchable` (one PDF,
  ~7s) proves upload → extract → project → search → dedup is connected, and
  `test_kreuzberg_extractor_behaviour_matrix` (five PDFs, three search
  methods, ~120s) covers the adapter's variations nightly. Before the split
  they were one test that cost 130 seconds on every PR — 5.6% of the entire
  suite.
- **Baseline it,** with a reason, when the cost is genuine work rather than
  waiting. One entry qualifies today: a journey that provisions a real Docker
  sandbox because nothing in-process proves that contract.

The dishonest answer is raising the budget.

Note what the budget cannot see: a test marked `slow` never reaches it, because
`slow` is filtered out before pytest writes the JUnit. That is the point — the
gate measures what a PR waits for, not what exists.

### Waiting

`docs/testing.md`'s rule is *wait on a condition, never on the clock*, and the
duration budget is what makes it enforceable rather than aspirational. Two
recent examples of the failure mode, both found by measuring rather than
reading: a cron test that waited for the real next minute boundary (41s → 1.5s
by making the occurrence due), and a statement-timeout test that waited out the
real 30-second default (30s → 1.0s by shrinking the timeout under test).

The two scenario **gate** jobs are cheap and stay on every pull request, and
they carry more weight than their runtime suggests: CI's quality job runs the
individual gate targets rather than `make quality`, so the specification-honesty
checks run nowhere else. Without them a promise could be marked `covered` with
no test and nothing would notice.

The lanes that boot a stack do not run on pull requests. They take minutes, they
are about the product rather than about the change, and a ten-minute wait on
every push buys little.

### What gates a merge

Three checks, all of them aggregators: **`CI passed`**, **`Backend E2E passed`**
and **`Security passed`**. `Backend E2E passed` covers the backend unit lane,
the e2e shards and the coverage floor. Everything else reports — a red nightly
or a red scenario lane is a thing to go and read, not a thing that stops you.

The required list lives in the `protect-main` ruleset, which is repository
settings and not a file here, so nothing in the tree can check it. Read it back
before trusting any claim about it, including this paragraph:

```bash
gh api repos/lemma-work/lemma-platform/rulesets \
  --jq '.[] | select(.name=="protect-main").id' \
| xargs -I{} gh api repos/lemma-work/lemma-platform/rulesets/{} \
  --jq '[.rules[] | select(.type=="required_status_checks")
         .parameters.required_status_checks[].context]'
```

It has been wrong twice. Until recently it required `lemma-backend unit` rather
than `CI passed`, which left every other job in `ci.yml` outside the gate — and
because that job is path-filtered, a pull request that missed `lemma-backend/`
reported `skipped`, **which GitHub counts as satisfying a required check**.

`Backend E2E passed` is an aggregator: it watches the whole shard matrix rather
than naming individual shards. That indirection is the point. The ruleset used
to require seven shards by name, which meant the shard layout could not be
changed without silently dropping a required check, the workflow could not be
skipped on a PR that cannot affect it, and one shard — `workspace` — had fallen
out of the list by accident and gated nothing at all. The aggregator reports
success when the matrix is correctly skipped, so path-filtering is safe, and
`scripts/check_ci_aggregators.py` fails the build if a job ever falls out of
its `needs:` list again.

Both workflows are path-filtered. A PR that touches only the frontend runs
neither, and both report green.

Coverage is one number with one floor. The `coverage` job in `e2e.yml`
combines the unit lane with every e2e shard, from the same checkout in the same
run, and fails if the total drops below `lemma-backend/coverage-floor.txt` **as
it is on `main`** — so a pull request cannot lower its own bar. The floor sits
about two points under the measured total, so a change may lose a little
coverage and still merge. The PR comment still breaks coverage down by module
and by lane; that table informs, it does not gate. When the total has risen for
good, raise the floor in its own change.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` names coverage below floor as a merge blocker. Run the
command rather than quoting a number:

```bash
make coverage-backend
```

---

## The two suites overlap, and both stay

The module e2e suite and the scenario suite touch many of the same endpoints.
That overlap is not duplication to be cleaned up. They are asking different
questions, so the same endpoint answering both is the normal case.

**Module e2e tests validate a module's contract.** They are meant to be fast,
they run in-process, and they can do the things a black-box test provably
cannot: force a dependency to fail, assert a query budget, read a database
post-condition, pin an exact refusal code. That is a category of coverage the
scenario suite cannot reach by design, because it forbids mocking.

**Scenarios validate a promise to a person.** They run over a socket against a
booted stack, so they see what a client sees — including the lifespan, the wire,
and the ordering of a write against the response that reports it.

Neither replaces the other, and **no test is deleted for being covered
elsewhere.** A test is deleted when it asserts nothing, or when the behaviour it
asserts is gone. Being redundant with a test in the other suite is not a reason.

This was measured before it was decided. A survey of 759 module e2e tests found
six files whose every operation a scenario already covers — the strongest
candidates for redundancy that exist. Examined by hand, **all six were still
worth keeping**, and for one consistent reason: they assert more *specifically*
than the scenarios do.

- Two assert query budgets — how many statements a request costs. No black-box
  test can see that.
- One pins the bundle format field by field. The scenario covering the same
  operations proves the exporter and importer agree with each other, which is a
  weaker claim: rename a key on both sides and it still passes.
- One pins exact refusal codes for a visibility matrix, including cases where a
  `404` becoming a `403` would leak that a resource exists. The scenarios use a
  helper that accepts any `4xx`.
- Two assert intermediate states and destructive effects — a cancelling import,
  a column actually removed — that no scenario asserts at all.

The useful direction is the other one: where a scenario is the weaker test,
**strengthen the scenario** — assert the refusal code where the code is the
point, pin the artifact format where it is an external contract. That adds
coverage instead of moving it.

### Where a new test goes

Use the three questions at the top of this document, not the overlap. A promise
to a person gets a scenario. A forced failure, a query budget, or an internal
invariant gets a module e2e test. One function gets a unit test. When a change
deserves both, write both.

## Rules that apply everywhere

**Test fixtures must not look like credentials.** A high-entropy literal shaped
like a real token is indistinguishable from one — to a reader, and to the secret
scanner, which is right to flag it. Build the value instead of writing it down.
`.gitleaks.toml` allows exactly one such vector and says why every other one
stays a finding.

**A test must not depend on the machine it runs on.** Not on a developer's
`.env`, not on which Docker images happen to be built, not on wall-clock speed.
Each of those has produced a suite that passed on one laptop and failed
everywhere else, and each is now guarded — see
`tests/scenarios/journeys/test_harness_contract.py`.

**Wait on a condition, never on the clock.** A sleep is either too short and
flakes under load, or too long and everyone pays for it on every run.

**Never leave a process behind.** Anything that spawns background load — a
stress loop, a dev server, a sidecar, a CPU hog used to reproduce a flake —
tears it down from a `trap`, never from the last line of the script. The last
line is not reached when the run times out, when the harness kills the command,
or when the session simply ends; the children are reparented onto pid 1 and
each one pins a core until a person notices. That is not hypothetical, and it
is not rare: a busy loop once ran for 20+ hours, and a later agent
reproducing a `locald` flake left nineteen `yes > /dev/null` spinners at ~45%
CPU each for an hour and a half, on an 11-core machine, while every command it
ran printed `load stopped`.

Do not write the loop again.
[`desktop/scripts/stress_test_under_load.sh`](../desktop/scripts/stress_test_under_load.sh)
already does it correctly — it traps `EXIT INT TERM HUP`, kills by array,
`wait`s, and enforces its own runtime ceiling so a hung test loop still tears
the load down.

Two details make the hand-rolled version fail silently, so both are worth
knowing before you reach for one anyway:

- **`kill` at the end of a script is not cleanup.** Only `trap` runs on the
  paths that actually happen. `HUP` needs naming explicitly — bash's default
  handler terminates *without* running the `EXIT` trap, so closing the terminal
  leaks everything.
- **Ad-hoc commands here run under `zsh`, which does not word-split.**
  `PIDS="$PIDS $!"` followed by `kill $PIDS` is a correct *bash* idiom that
  does nothing at all in zsh: the whole string arrives as a single argument,
  `kill` exits 1, and the `2>/dev/null` everyone appends hides it. Collect into
  an array and `kill "${PIDS[@]}"`. `jobs -p` is the same trap from the other
  side — inside `$(...)` it is a subshell with an empty jobs table, so
  `kill $(jobs -p)` reliably kills nothing.

A script that owns background processes belongs in a file with a
`#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang, not inlined into a shell command, for exactly
this reason.

**A stub is legitimate only when a contract test pins both sides against one
committed artifact.** A stand-in you wrote proves your half of an interface and
certifies nothing about the half that ships. This is not hypothetical: the
Python stub guest returned a top-level `sandbox_id` where the real guest nests
it, and every test against the stub passed.

Two pairs do this properly today, and both follow the same shape — one JSON
file in the repo, asserted from both languages, with the failure it exists to
catch written into the file itself:

| Contract | Asserted from |
|---|---|
| `desktop/agent-host/tests/fixtures/wire_contract.json` | the Agent Host (Rust) and the backend (Python) |
| `desktop/contracts/host-pack-layout.json` | `native_host_pack.rs` (consumer) and `build_local_host_pack.py` (producer) |

The host-pack one is worth reading as the example, because it is the case where
nothing *could* have caught the drift: the producer is a Python script run by a
release job, the consumer hard-codes a dozen paths, and a PR runs the consumer's
tests against a fixture the same PR wrote. A rename lands green on both sides
and is found by whoever installs the release — as `NotFound` and the name of a
file they have never heard of.

Prefer running the producer to reading its source. Where a path is assembled
from pieces rather than spelled out, a substring assertion proves nothing;
`copy_node_runtime` and `copy_browser_assets` are both called for real against a
temporary directory, and the contract marks those entries `producer_writes:
null` so the weaker check knows to stand aside.

**A failing test is evidence, not an obstacle.** If a scenario fails because the
product is wrong, the finding goes in [`issues.md`](../issues.md) with a `DEV-`
id, the promise moves to `gap`, and the scenario is marked
`xfail(strict=True)` so the build turns red the moment somebody fixes it.

---

## Known limits

Written down because a limit nobody has recorded gets rediscovered as a bug.

- **Scenario coverage feeds no gate.** The suite can measure backend coverage
  (`SCENARIOS_COVERAGE=1`), but `scenarios.yml` does not upload it, so the
  floors in `e2e.yml` see module e2e coverage only. So the floors under-report
  what is actually exercised, and a line only a scenario reaches counts as
  uncovered.
- **Consent flows cannot be automated.** Google deliberately blocks automated
  sign-in. The live lane proves the connect flow a deployment hands a person —
  the right client, the scopes, offline access — and stops there.
- **Some promises are `manual`.** They name what verifies them and why a machine
  cannot. See the status legend in [the specification](product/README.md).

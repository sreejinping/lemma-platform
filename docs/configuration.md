# Configuring Lemma

This is the operator's view of Lemma's configuration: the settings you set to
run or deploy it, what each one decides, and why you would change it. It is not
an exhaustive dump of every field — the platform declares a few hundred, most of
which are tuning knobs with defaults that are correct until a specific problem
says otherwise. Those are listed in the settings classes named at the end.

Every setting is an environment variable. Names are the upper-cased field name
of a `pydantic-settings` class, so what you see here is what the process reads.

## Where settings come from

The backend reads its environment, then `lemma-backend/.env` in its working
directory. A real environment variable always wins over the file. Setting
`LEMMA_DISABLE_DOTENV=1` skips the file entirely, which is what the test suite
does so a developer's local `.env` cannot change a test result.

How that environment gets built depends on how you run Lemma:

| How you run it | What writes the environment |
| --- | --- |
| `make dev` from a checkout | `lemma-backend/.env`, created by `make init`, plus the dev overrides in the root `Makefile` |
| `lemma-stack` (Docker or Podman) | `lemma_stack/config/render.py`, from `~/.lemma/local/config.toml` |
| Lemma Desktop | `locald`'s native host pack renderer, from the same config file |
| Your own deployment | Whatever your platform injects |

For the two managed paths you do not edit the environment directly. You edit
`~/.lemma/local/config.toml` — `lemma-stack config set KEY value` — and the
renderer produces the environment from it. Anything under `[backend.env]` is
passed to the backend verbatim and applied last, so it overrides a rendered
default. `[frontend.env]` does the same for the frontend.

## Runtime and logging

```dotenv
# local | development | production | testing. Outside local/testing, some
# settings stop having safe defaults and are required — APP_BASE_DOMAIN is one.
ENVIRONMENT=production
# Off by default, and refused outside local/testing: it replaces the standard
# error envelope with a source-annotated traceback on every unhandled error.
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# Structured JSON on stdout. Turn it off locally if you read logs by eye.
JSON_LOGS_ENABLED=true
# Per-request access logs. Noisy in production, useful in a checkout.
LOCAL_HTTP_ACCESS_LOGS_ENABLED=false
# The source commit this image was built from. Required in production —
# startup refuses to continue without it. See "Release identity" below.
LEMMA_RELEASE_SHA=4f2c1a9e8b7d3f5a1c0e6b2d8a4f7c3e9b1d5a02
# Serve /docs, /redoc, /scalar and /openapi.json. Off unless set. See
# "API documentation" below.
API_DOCS_ENABLED=false
```

### API documentation

`API_DOCS_ENABLED` gates `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/redoc` and `/scalar`
together. It defaults to **off**, and it is a flag rather than something
inferred from `ENVIRONMENT`, so **every** deployment that wants the docs has to
say so — staging and preview environments included, not just production. A
deployment that sets nothing serves nothing and returns 404.

That is the deliberate direction to fail in. The alternative is inferring from
`ENVIRONMENT`, where a deployment that forgets to set it, or sets a value the
check does not recognise, starts publishing the shape of every endpoint to
anyone who asks. Nothing in production reads these: both SDKs are generated at
build time and the route inventory is a CI gate. Generating the document also
costs ~3.35s of a cold start, measured in a production container.

`make init` writes `API_DOCS_ENABLED=true` into the generated `.env`, so a local
checkout has them without doing anything.

### Release identity

`LEMMA_RELEASE_SHA` is what makes a metric, a log line, or a trace attributable
to a deploy. It becomes `service.version` on the OpenTelemetry resource and
`service.version`/`release.sha` on every log line, and without it you cannot
answer whether a release caused a latency change.

It must be the **full 40-character lowercase hex git SHA**. Nothing else is
accepted, and the failure is quiet in the direction that matters: a short SHA,
an image digest (`sha256:…`), a tag, or a branch name all fail the format check
and fall back to the string `unknown`, which is what every dashboard then
groups by. Set it from the source commit and bump it alongside the image digest
at release.

Production is stricter — startup raises if the value is missing or malformed.
So a *running* production process reporting `service.version=unknown` means
`ENVIRONMENT` is not being seen as `production` either, and that is worth
fixing first.

There is no `OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION`; the OTel SDK does not define one, and this
setting is where the value comes from.

`SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID` is not a setting — `service.instance.id` is derived
automatically from `LEMMA_RUNTIME_INSTANCE_ID` if set, and otherwise from the
hostname, which under Kubernetes is the pod name. It is what keeps replicas
from colliding on the same metric series.

## Database and Redis

Lemma uses two Postgres databases: the application database and a separate
datastore database holding pod data, which is queried under row-level security
by a lower-privilege role. Redis carries the event streams and caches.

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/lemma
DATASTORE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/lemma_datastore
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Pool sizing. One number, used by both engines, and it is a hard ceiling —
# there is no overflow — so a process opens at most DB_POOL_SIZE connections per
# engine and cluster capacity stays predictable when replicas autoscale.
DB_POOL_SIZE=10
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=50
```

### Sizing the pool

Size `DB_POOL_SIZE` from concurrent in-flight *queries*, not from request or
task concurrency. A session holds its connection only for one unit of work and
gives it back before any LLM call, HTTP request, sandbox operation or thread
offload — `make lint-session-scope` fails the build if that stops being true.
So the steady-state demand is roughly `queries_per_second × seconds_per_query`.
An agent run spends 95%+ of its wall clock outside the database, which is why a
worker at `WORKER_CONCURRENCY=50` still needs single-digit connections in
steady state. The pool is there to absorb the burst at task start and finish.

Raise it in response to measurement, not anticipation: the backend reports a
`database_pool_capacity` incident when checkout saturation is sustained, and
`pg_stat_activity` shows what the server actually sees. `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` is
a RAM and CPU budget for the pod, unrelated to the pool.

### Enforcing the cluster-wide ceiling

Per-process arithmetic (`replicas × pool size < max_connections`) stops holding
the moment an autoscaler, a rolling deploy or a migration job changes the
replica count. Enforce it where it is actually enforceable — at the server:

```sql
ALTER ROLE lemma_app CONNECTION LIMIT 200;
```

Postgres then refuses connection 201 instead of letting a runaway deployment
consume the slots reserved for administration. For deployments large enough
that the total starts to matter, put a transaction-mode pooler (PgBouncer, or
whatever your managed provider offers) in front and let the per-process pools
stay small and uniform. Two things in this codebase are deliberately kept
compatible with that: no session-level state outside a transaction (always
`SET LOCAL`, never bare `SET`), and only transaction-scoped advisory locks
(`pg_advisory_xact_lock`).

## Sandboxes

Agent workspaces and function runs both execute in sandboxes that the backend
provisions itself. `WORKSPACE_PROVIDER` chooses what a sandbox is made of:

| Value | Sandbox is | Where the files live |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker` (default) | A container on a Docker or Podman socket | A separate volume, kept when the container is replaced |
| `e2b` | An E2B sandbox | The sandbox itself — there is no volume behind it |
| `lemma_local` | A container inside Lemma Desktop's private VM | A bind mount inside the guest |

That difference decides what happens when a sandbox has to be recreated. On
Docker and `lemma_local` the compute is replaced and the files survive. On E2B
the sandbox *is* the disk, so recreating one loses its contents; the backend
reports this so the user can be told rather than silently handed an empty
workspace.

### What each provider actually reads

`WorkspaceSettings` declares every field regardless of provider, so a value
being *set* does not mean it is *used*. Setting one the active provider ignores
is harmless, but it is not a substitute for the one that matters.

| Setting | `docker` | `e2b` | `lemma_local` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WORKSPACE_IMAGE` / `FUNCTION_IMAGE` | **required** | not used | **required** |
| `E2B_API_KEY`, `E2B_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE`, `E2B_FUNCTION_TEMPLATE` | not used | **required** | not used |
| `WORKSPACE_PROFILE_DIGEST` / `FUNCTION_PROFILE_DIGEST` | **used** | **used** | **used** |
| `WORKSPACE_RUNTIME_CREDENTIAL_KEY` | **required** | **required** | **required** |
| `WORKSPACE_DOCKER_*`, `WORKSPACE_ADD_HOST_GATEWAY`, `WORKSPACE_HOST_ALIAS` | **used** | not used | not used |
| `WORKSPACE_LOCAL_*` | not used | not used | **required** |

**Under `e2b`, the images are not what a sandbox is made from — the templates
are.** `E2BSandboxProvider.create` passes `template=...` and never reads the
image, so leaving `WORKSPACE_IMAGE` at its default is correct there.

**Nothing moves an existing workspace onto a rebuilt template**, and that is
deliberate: on E2B the sandbox *is* the disk, so replacing one to adopt a newer
image deletes the user's files. Both the template and the profile digest are
stamped into sandbox metadata, drift in either is recorded, and the sandbox is
adopted as it stands. The first-party Lemma code a workspace runs — the CLI, the
SDK, the skills, the browser relay — is installed into the running sandbox
instead (`WORKSPACE_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_DIR`), so shipping a code change no longer
needs a template at all. A genuinely new base image reaches an existing
workspace only when that workspace is next created from scratch.

Function sandboxes are the opposite, because they own no durable disk: drift
replaces them, which costs a cold start and nothing else.

```dotenv
WORKSPACE_PROVIDER=docker

# Docker and lemma_local only. Pin by digest in any real deployment;
# WORKSPACE_DOCKER_ALLOW_MUTABLE_IMAGES=false refuses a tag that is not pinned.
WORKSPACE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/lemma-work/lemma-workspace@sha256:...
FUNCTION_IMAGE=ghcr.io/lemma-work/lemma-function@sha256:...

# Signs the per-sandbox credential the in-sandbox runtime accepts. At least 32
# bytes. Required for any provider that runs a workspace runtime.
WORKSPACE_RUNTIME_CREDENTIAL_KEY=...

# Release an idle workspace after this long. The sweep that enforces it runs on
# WORKSPACE_SWEEP_CRON. Releasing keeps the files; it stops the compute.
WORKSPACE_IDLE_RELEASE_SECONDS=900
WORKSPACE_SWEEP_CRON=*/5 * * * *
```

### Making a new sandbox image take effect

What a digest bump does depends on whether the sandbox owns a disk separate from
itself, so this is stated per provider.

**Under `docker` and `lemma_local`,** a sandbox is reused only when the profile
digest recorded on it matches `WORKSPACE_PROFILE_DIGEST` (or
`FUNCTION_PROFILE_DIGEST` for function runtimes). This is the supported way to
force existing workspaces onto a new image: publish the image, point
`WORKSPACE_IMAGE` at it, and bump the digest in the same change. The container
is destroyed and rebuilt; its volume is a separate object and is adopted
afterwards, so the user's files survive. Without the bump, a workspace that
already exists keeps running the image it was created from for as long as it
lives, and a fix shipped in the image never reaches anyone who already has a
workspace.

**Under `e2b`, a bump does not move an existing workspace.** There the sandbox
*is* the disk, so the drift is recorded and the sandbox adopted as it stands --
see above. Bump the digest anyway when you publish a template: it is what
workspaces created from then on are stamped with, and it is what makes function
sandboxes, which own no disk, pick the new template up. But do not expect it to
re-home a workspace that already exists; nothing does, by design. Ship
first-party code changes through the runtime bundle instead, which reaches
running workspaces without a template at all.

The digest is an opaque identity — any `sha256:` value works, as long as it
changes when the image does.

```dotenv
WORKSPACE_PROFILE_NAME=workspace-python-v1
WORKSPACE_PROFILE_DIGEST=sha256:<64 hex characters>
FUNCTION_PROFILE_NAME=function-python-v1
FUNCTION_PROFILE_DIGEST=sha256:<64 hex characters>
```

### Docker and Podman

```dotenv
WORKSPACE_DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH=/var/run/docker.sock
# Put sandboxes on a private network the backend also joins, so they reach it
# by DNS alias instead of through the host.
WORKSPACE_DOCKER_PRIVATE_NETWORK=lemma-local-net
# Refuse an image that is not pinned by digest. Only relax this in a checkout,
# where the dev images are tagged :dev.
WORKSPACE_DOCKER_ALLOW_MUTABLE_IMAGES=false
# When sandboxes are NOT on a shared network, they need a route back to the
# host. Both are set together: an alias without the gateway entry provisions
# fine and then fails on the sandbox's first call back.
WORKSPACE_ADD_HOST_GATEWAY=true
WORKSPACE_HOST_ALIAS=host.docker.internal
```

### E2B

```dotenv
E2B_API_KEY=...
E2B_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE=lemma-workspace
E2B_FUNCTION_TEMPLATE=lemma-function
# Only for a self-hosted or non-default E2B deployment.
E2B_DOMAIN=
# Namespace for the metadata the provider writes and queries. Leave unset in
# production; override it for anything sharing an E2B account with real
# workspaces.
E2B_METADATA_NAMESPACE=
# Only for a deployment whose plans sell workspace sizes. JSON, keyed
# `{cpu}x{memory_mb}`, one template per size.
E2B_WORKSPACE_SIZE_TEMPLATES=
```

These six are the whole backend-side E2B surface. In particular:

- **A workspace size is a template.** E2B fixes CPU and memory when a template
  is built, so a deployment whose plans size workspaces builds one workspace
  template per size — `build_templates.py --name-suffix -4x8192` with
  `E2B_WORKSPACE_CPU_COUNT=4` and `E2B_WORKSPACE_MEMORY_MB=8192` — and maps
  the sizes here, e.g. `{"4x8192": "lemma-workspace-4x8192"}`. A size with no
  entry is served from `E2B_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE`, and logged. Without a plan
  provider nothing asks for a size and this is never read. A workspace that
  already exists keeps the template it was created on: here the sandbox is its
  disk, so it cannot be rebuilt at a new size without carrying its files across.

- **Whether a sandbox is on the internet is not one of them.** E2B gives every
  port a sandbox listens on a public name, so sandboxes are created closed:
  E2B mints a per-sandbox traffic token, the edge answers 403 without it, and
  the backend carries that token on every call it makes. This used to be
  `E2B_ALLOW_PUBLIC_TRAFFIC` and is now `CLOSED_TO_THE_INTERNET`, a constant in
  the E2B provider. Nothing outside the backend ever needs a sandbox's own
  address — a browser is handed a signed URL at Lemma's own API, which
  reverse-proxies to the port — so the setting's only other position exposed
  whatever was listening, including the agent's browser and its dashboard, for
  nothing in return. Setting the variable now configures nothing.

  It is fixed when a sandbox is created and cannot be changed afterwards, so
  sandboxes made before this stay open until they are replaced; the backend
  reports those as public rather than assuming, and refuses to put a saved
  login into one.

- **`E2B_METADATA_NAMESPACE` is a safety boundary.** A provider is blind to
  sandboxes labelled with any other namespace, and the orphan sweep destroys
  every object it *can* identify that has no sandbox row. A test runs against a
  throwaway database in which no production workspace has a row, so a test
  sharing this value with a live account would sweep that account's workspaces
  away. E2E runs generate their own namespace and refuse to start in the
  production one.

- **`E2B_WORKSPACE_BUILD_ID` and `E2B_FUNCTION_BUILD_ID` are not backend
  settings.** `WorkspaceSettings` does not declare them and the backend never
  reads them. They are GitHub Actions repository variables, consumed by the
  E2B conformance and function-benchmark workflows to pin the exact template
  build those runs exercise. Setting them in a deployment environment does
  nothing; do not treat a template id alone as an unpinned deployment.
- A template name is a moving pointer: rebuilding a template under the same
  name changes what a *new* sandbox is made from. It does not touch workspace
  sandboxes that already exist, and no setting makes it — see above.

### The sandbox browser's proxy

```dotenv
# Comma-separated pool of proxy URLs the sandbox browser routes through.
# Credentials inline where the proxy needs them. Empty (the default) means a
# direct connection. SecretStr: never logged.
WORKSPACE_BROWSER_PROXY_URLS=http://user:pass@residential.example:8080,http://user:pass@residential-2.example:8080
```

**Asserted at every browser start, not at sandbox creation.** Emptying the
pool withdraws the proxy from existing sandboxes the next time their browser
starts — no restart, no recreation. This was not true before: the value was
baked into the sandbox's creation environment, so it could be given and never
taken back, and workspace sandboxes are not replaced on template drift.

**One sandbox keeps one entry.** Chosen by hashing the sandbox id, so it
survives restarts, resumes and container replacement. Adding an entry moves
roughly a 1/n share of sandboxes; removing one moves only the sandboxes that
held it. A sandbox's exit IP changes when you change the pool, and not
otherwise. That matters because the feature exists for sign-in pages: a
session cookie bound to an IP logs the person out when the IP hops.

**A person watching right now keeps the browser they have.** A change of
decision closes the browser at the next start so the new setting takes
effect; it does not interrupt a viewer mid-session.

**Every fabric.** The previous mechanism reached only Docker and E2B —
`lemma_local` never read the provisioning environment at all, so the desktop
fabric was never proxied and nothing said so.

**The agent can read the proxy URL.** It is delivered `0600` into a sandbox
with one unprivileged user, which is the agent's own user, and it lands in
`config.json` in the same mode. That keeps it out of a file listing and out
of `/proc/*/cmdline`; it does not hide it from the agent. Put nothing here
that is not scoped to this use.

This setting is deliberately *not* one of the things needing an image roll
(see [Making a new sandbox image take effect](#making-a-new-sandbox-image-take-effect)),
because the decision travels as data rather than as part of the image.

### Reaching a sandbox

Sandboxes call back into Lemma — the CLI inside a workspace, a function
fetching its artifact. These URLs are what they are told to use, and they are
resolved from the sandbox's network position, not the browser's.

```dotenv
WORKSPACE_CALLBACK_API_URL=http://backend:8000
WORKSPACE_CALLBACK_AUTH_URL=http://frontend:8080/auth
WORKSPACE_CALLBACK_FRONTEND_URL=http://frontend:8080
FUNCTION_RUNTIME_GATEWAY_URL=http://backend:8000
```

`WORKSPACE_PORT_ACCESS_URL` publishes a port a workspace opened, for previewing
something running inside it.

## Function execution

```dotenv
# How long an API-style call and a job-style run may take before they are cut off.
FUNCTION_API_DEADLINE_SECONDS=120
FUNCTION_JOB_DEADLINE_SECONDS=600
# Reuse a resolved runtime endpoint for this long instead of re-resolving per
# call. Keep it well below WORKSPACE_IDLE_RELEASE_SECONDS, or a cached endpoint
# can outlive the sandbox it points at.
FUNCTION_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT_REUSE_SECONDS=60
```

## Build retention

Every app deploy stores a whole dist, and every function code save stores a whole
artifact. Nothing removed either until this existed, so storage grew with every
deploy for the life of the install. **Retention is on by default and deletes on
the first run after upgrade** — an app with more than `APP_RELEASE_MAX_KEEP`
releases will lose the oldest ones. Set the `*_ENABLED` flags to `false` before
upgrading if you want to look first.

Three knobs, because two are not enough. `KEEP_LAST` is a floor: the N newest
survive at any age, so an app nobody has deployed in a year can still be rolled
back the day a bad deploy lands. `KEEP_DAYS` keeps work that is still being
iterated on. `MAX_KEEP` is the ceiling, and it is what makes the whole thing
bounded — "keep anything recent" has no upper limit of its own, so fifty deploys
in one afternoon would mean fifty retained builds for the next thirty days.

The live release and the live revision are exempt at any age or rank, as is any
revision a PENDING or RUNNING run is pinned to. A pruned entry keeps its row and
shows as "build removed" rather than vanishing, so the history has no
unexplained gaps — but its source and build are removed, so it can no longer be
inspected, previewed, promoted or run. Failed storage deletions remain pending
until cleanup succeeds, even after the retained count reaches its floor.

```dotenv
APP_RELEASE_RETENTION_ENABLED=true
APP_RELEASE_KEEP_LAST=10      # floor: never prune the newest N, whatever their age
APP_RELEASE_KEEP_DAYS=30      # keep anything younger than this, up to the ceiling
APP_RELEASE_MAX_KEEP=20       # ceiling: must be >= KEEP_LAST or startup refuses
APP_RELEASE_RETENTION_CRON="20 4 * * *"
# Apps per round trip. The sweep pages until the candidate set is drained, so
# this bounds one query rather than deciding which apps ever get swept.
APP_RELEASE_RETENTION_BATCH=200
# Wall-clock budget for one sweep. ZERO MEANS UNLIMITED here, unlike
# FUNCTION_RUN_RETENTION_BUDGET_SECONDS where zero disables the sweep.
APP_RELEASE_RETENTION_BUDGET_SECONDS=60

FUNCTION_REVISION_RETENTION_ENABLED=true
FUNCTION_REVISION_KEEP_LAST=10
FUNCTION_REVISION_KEEP_DAYS=30
FUNCTION_REVISION_MAX_KEEP=20
FUNCTION_REVISION_RETENTION_CRON="40 4 * * *"
FUNCTION_REVISION_RETENTION_BATCH=200
FUNCTION_REVISION_RETENTION_BUDGET_SECONDS=60
```

Pruning also runs inline after a deploy or a code save, which is when storage
actually grows; the crons are the backstop for a resource that has *stopped*
being deployed. Watch `apps.tasks.sweep_app_releases.observed`: `examined` high
while `pruned_apps` stays flat means the sweep is finding candidates it never
prunes, which is worth investigating.

## URLs, CORS and cookies

`API_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` are what a browser uses, so they must be the public
origins, not internal service names. Apps that pods publish are served at
`<slug>.<APP_BASE_DOMAIN>`, which is required outside `local` and `testing`.

```dotenv
API_URL=https://api.example.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://app.example.com
AUTH_FRONTEND_URL=https://app.example.com
APP_BASE_DOMAIN=apps.example.com
SUPERTOKENS_CORE_URL=http://supertokens:3567

CORS_ORIGINS=["https://app.example.com"]
CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX=
# Leave the domain blank for a host-only cookie. Set it only when the UI and API
# are on different subdomains that must share a session.
SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN=
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
SESSION_COOKIE_SAME_SITE=lax
```

## Authentication and email

Email transport, sender identity, and the sign-up abuse controls are covered in
[authentication hardening](authentication-hardening.md), which documents the
`AUTH_*`, `SMTP_*` and `RESEND_*` settings together with the reasoning behind
each default. The short version:

```dotenv
EMAIL_TRANSPORT=smtp          # smtp | filesystem
EMAIL_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/lemma-emails   # filesystem transport only
AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=true
AUTH_ABUSE_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true
# open | invite_only | closed. Unset means open.
SIGNUP_MODE=
```

### Who may sign up

`SIGNUP_MODE` decides who can create an account, on every path that creates
one — email and password, an OAuth provider, and email-code sign-in:

- `open` — anyone who reaches the sign-up page. The default for hosted and
  self-hosted deployments, and what they did before the setting existed.
- `invite_only` — only an address holding a pending, unexpired organization
  invitation. Anyone else is told "This Lemma is invite-only. Ask someone
  already on it for an invitation."
- `closed` — nobody.

People who already have an account sign in whatever the mode is — a sign-up
for an address that already has a password is answered "you already have an
account", with a way to sign in, never with the mode's refusal — and the first
account on a deployment with no accounts at all is admitted whatever the mode —
there is nobody yet who could have invited it. That check is a read, not a
reservation: two signups racing on an empty database could both get in, so a
server that wants a closed door from the first request should create its first
account before exposing the sign-up page.

Unset means `open` on Lemma Desktop too. Desktop sets `SIGNUP_MODE` only while
the installation is shared, from its *Who can join* choice; see
[Desktop security](architecture/desktop-security.md).

**Resend is not a transport.** To send through Resend, leave
`EMAIL_TRANSPORT=smtp`, set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, and leave
`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` and `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` unset — the
sender then dials `smtp.resend.com:465` with the key as the password. Setting
all four explicit SMTP values wins over Resend, which is how a deployment ends
up sending through a server it configured months ago and forgot.

`EMAIL_TRANSPORT=resend` was documented here and is not a value the setting
accepts. It aborts `Settings()` at import, before logging is set up, so the
operator gets a bare pydantic traceback rather than a message.

`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` has **no default**. It used to fall back to a Lemma-owned
domain, which meant an unconfigured deployment sent password resets from a
domain it did not own — those fail DMARC silently and lock people out with
nothing in the logs to explain it. Set it, or leave Resend unconfigured.

**When no mail can be sent.** With `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=smtp` and neither Resend
nor all four SMTP values set, nothing is sent and each attempt logs
`identity.email.not_sent` at warning level with the reason. The product says so
where it would otherwise promise mail: a new invitation comes back with
`emailed: false` and its `accept_url`, which the People page offers to copy; a
password reset answers that email isn't set up; and email-code sign-in refuses
before minting a code (`EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED`) and points at a password instead.
The filesystem transport is not "no mail" in this sense — it writes a spool for
tests and the dev stack to read, and every send succeeds. Chat signup is the
exception that treats the spool as no mail, because nobody in a chat can read
it: on either, a sender a shared bot does not recognise is told how to be
recognised instead of being asked for an address (see
[chat onboarding](operators/chat-onboarding.md)).

On a local installation (`ENVIRONMENT=local`), a signed-in user can ask whether
mail can be sent (`GET /users/me/email-delivery`) and send a test email to their
own address (`POST /users/me/email-delivery/test`, rate limited per account
while the auth abuse controls are on). Both answer 404 on any other deployment.

### Agent email surfaces

Separate from the transactional mail above: this is how *agents* send and
receive email. Each agent gets its own address at creation, which people can
write to and reply to. The address is returned as `surface_identity_email` on
the surfaces API; no screen displays it yet, so today you read it from the API
or from the `agent_surfaces` row.

```dotenv
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...              # shared with transactional mail above
RESEND_INBOUND_DOMAIN=ops.example.com   # verified, catch-all inbound
RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...    # Svix secret for the inbound webhook
RESEND_FROM_NAME=Lemma
```

Point a Resend webhook at `POST /surfaces/webhooks/resend` and select
`email.received`. Two things are worth knowing:

- **`RESEND_INBOUND_DOMAIN` has no default and must be a domain you own.** Agent
  addresses are minted on it (`{agent}.{pod}@{domain}`, and `{pod}@{domain}` for
  the pod's own assistant) and inbound routing matches on it, so a wrong value
  means mail that bounces on the way out and matches no surface on the way back.
  The domain is one catch-all shared by every organization, so role addresses
  are reserved: a pod named "Postmaster" gets `postmaster-k3p9@`, never
  `postmaster@`. Matching ignores separators, so "Post Master" and "Post-Master"
  are the same request and get the same answer.
- **The key and the domain together are the switch.** Set both and every pod and
  agent gets a mailbox as it is created; leave either unset and they do not.
  There is no separate enable flag — there was one, and being read per process
  it could be on where the surfaces catalog runs and off where sends run, which
  presents as the UI offering email while delivery reports that the pod has no
  surface.
- **One mailbox per agent, and connecting email returns it.** The address exists
  from the moment the agent does, so `POST /pods/{id}/surfaces` with no `name`
  hands back the surface already carrying it rather than minting a second one.
  Pass a `name` to create a genuinely separate Resend surface.
- **`RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is per *endpoint*.** Svix derives the signature from
  the secret of the endpoint that sent the request, so if bounces are a separate
  Resend endpoint, its secret differs — set `RESEND_BOUNCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for
  that one and leave this as the main webhook's. A single endpoint carrying both
  event types needs only `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

A mailbox is created when an agent first needs one and has no other way to reach
anyone — including the pod's own assistant, and agents that predate per-agent
mailboxes. Nothing is minted for a pod that never messages anybody.

Because every pod sends from that one verified domain, its deliverability and
abuse reputation are shared. Two limits bound that, both in Redis and both
fixed-window:

| Limit | Scope | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notifications | per pod, per recipient, per hour | 20 |
| Outbound emails | per pod, per day | 200 |

The second is the one that matters for a shared domain: an agent messaging five
hundred different people once each never trips the first. Both fail *open* if
Redis is unreachable — "nobody can be told anything while Redis is down" is the
wrong way for a notification system to fail. Over the email budget the
notification is still created and still in the recipient's Lemma inbox; only the
mail is declined.

## Storage

Object storage holds uploads and generated artifacts. `auto` picks local disk
when no bucket is configured. See
[object storage](../lemma-backend/docs/operators/object-storage.md) for the
per-cloud credentials.

```dotenv
STORAGE_BACKEND=auto          # auto | local | gcs | s3 | azure
STORAGE_BUCKET=
LOCAL_OBJECT_STORAGE_ROOT=/var/lib/lemma/object-storage
LOCAL_FILE_STORAGE_ROOT=/var/lib/lemma/files
```

## Secret encryption

Connector credentials and other stored secrets are encrypted at rest. The
provider decides where the key comes from. `auto` resolves by what you have
configured, in this order: `gcp_kms` when `GCP_KMS_KEY_NAME` is set, else
`gcp_secret_manager` when `GCP_SECRET_MANAGER_SECRET_NAME` is set, else
`static`.

```dotenv
SECRET_KEY_PROVIDER=auto      # auto | static | gcp_kms | gcp_secret_manager | keychain
SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
GCP_KMS_KEY_NAME=
```

The local-key provider is named `static`. This said `env`, which the setting
does not accept and which aborts `Settings()` at import.

Rotating or losing this key makes every encrypted row unreadable. Treat it as
durable state, not configuration.

## Models

Lemma talks to any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible endpoint. There is
no provider-specific logic beyond those two shapes.

```dotenv
LEMMA_DEFAULT_MODEL_TYPE=openai_compat   # openai_compat | anthropic_compat
LEMMA_OPENAI_API_KEY=
LEMMA_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LEMMA_OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL=
# Comma-separated. The vision list marks which of them accept images.
LEMMA_OPENAI_MODEL_NAMES=
LEMMA_OPENAI_VISION_MODEL_NAMES=

LEMMA_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
LEMMA_ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5

# Embeddings and reranking for datastore search. `local` runs in-process and
# needs no key; the dimension must match what your index was built with.
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=auto       # auto | local | openai_compat
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=768
RERANKER_MODE=off             # off | local | openai_compat

WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=auto      # auto | duckduckgo | searxng | brave
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=
SEARXNG_URL=
```

## Spend limits

Nothing is limited by default: usage is metered but never refused. Set any of
these and model work that would take an organization or a person past the limit
is refused with `USAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, naming which limit was reached. A
billing or plan module, where one is installed, takes precedence over all of it.

A limit is enforced against a price, and there is not always a trustworthy one.
By default that work runs rather than being refused — see [When the cost of the
work cannot be
established](#when-the-cost-of-the-work-cannot-be-established) below, which
every deployment that bills for usage needs to read.

```dotenv
# USD. Unset means unlimited.
USAGE_ORG_MONTHLY_LIMIT_USD=
USAGE_USER_WEEKLY_LIMIT_USD=
USAGE_USER_MONTHLY_LIMIT_USD=

# Per-organization monthly caps, overriding USAGE_ORG_MONTHLY_LIMIT_USD.
# A JSON list; each entry names either an exact `slug` or a `slug_prefix`.
USAGE_ORG_LIMIT_OVERRIDES_JSON=
```

An override entry looks like `{"slug": "acme", "monthly_limit_usd": 5.0}`, or
`{"slug_prefix": "trial-", "monthly_limit_usd": 0}` to cap a family of
organizations at once. Slugs are organization handles, not display names.

### When the cost of the work cannot be established

A limit is enforced against a price, and there is not always one to enforce
against. The price catalog will only back a budget when it matched the model
through *that provider's own* base URL — so a model served through an
OpenAI-compatible gateway (vLLM, LiteLLM, OpenRouter, a hosted inference
provider, a corporate proxy) resolves the **vendor's** list price rather than
what the gateway charges to serve it, and is deliberately not enforceable.
`gpt-4o` behind a gateway is as unenforceable as anything else.

```dotenv
# allow (default) | refuse
USAGE_UNPRICED_LIMIT_POLICY=allow
```

`allow` drops the refusal, not the accounting. The request runs and is metered,
and is still priced with whatever rate the catalog holds — which for a gateway
is the vendor's list price, so the limit goes on binding *approximately* rather
than not at all. Only a model the catalog knows no rate for at all is recorded
with no cost. It is the default because refusing is almost always the wrong
answer for whoever reaches this: a spend cap set as a guardrail became a total
outage the moment it was pointed at a gateway.

**`refuse` is what you want if you bill somebody else for this usage** — a
limit you cannot measure is not a limit — and you have to set it, because the
default will not. If you run a paid multi-tenant deployment, set it now:

```dotenv
USAGE_UNPRICED_LIMIT_POLICY=refuse
```

Either way, the API and worker report at startup which models cannot back a
limit, so a deployment on the default is told when its limits have stopped
binding rather than discovering it from a bill.

This setting covers the **price** and nothing else. A request whose *shape* has
no price — a priority service tier, `extra_body` raising the output ceiling, 1h
cache writes — is asking the provider for billable work the adapter never sees,
and is refused under a monetary limit whatever this is set to.

The third option is to state the prices yourself, which makes them enforceable
and keeps the limit binding:

```dotenv
LEMMA_SYSTEM_MODEL_METADATA_JSON='{"my-model": {"input_per_million_usd": 0.14, "output_per_million_usd": 0.28}}'
```

Set a limit without stating prices and the API and worker say so at startup,
naming the models and the policy in force — look for
`agent.module.system_models_cannot_back_a_spend_limit.degraded`. It is logged
only when a limit could actually apply, so a deployment with no limits stays
quiet.
`0` refuses all model work for that organization, which is how you park one
without deleting it.

The most specific rule wins, not the last one written: an exact `slug` beats
any `slug_prefix`, and a longer prefix beats a shorter one. Two rules of equal
specificity are settled by the later one. Malformed JSON applies **no**
per-organization caps and logs a warning at startup — check for
`usage.limit_overrides.unparseable` if a cap you expected is not biting.

## Document processing

```dotenv
DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR=markitdown # markitdown | docling | kreuzberg
DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_OCR_ENABLED=false
DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_MAX_FILE_BYTES=
DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_LAYOUT_STRATEGY=auto  # auto | always
DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_TABLE_MODEL=tatr      # tatr | slanet_plus | disabled | …
DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_EXTRACTOR_MAX_THREADS=4
```

`markitdown` runs in-process. `docling` and `kreuzberg` are HTTP services and
need `DOCLING_SERVE_URL` or `KREUZBERG_URL` respectively. The `kreuzberg`
adapter also speaks the Xberg 1.x wire format (the renamed continuation of the
project), so the engine can be swapped by changing the image tag alone.

Layout inference dominates extraction cost, so `DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_LAYOUT_STRATEGY`
is the main CPU-per-document lever: `auto` pre-screens pages and runs the model
only where it helps, `always` runs it on every page. It is honoured by Xberg 1.x;
Kreuzberg v4 has no page-selection knob and always runs layout.
`DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_EXTRACTOR_MAX_THREADS` caps the extractor's internal thread
pool — left unset it sizes itself from the host CPU count and ignores the
container's CPU limit.

### Embedding

```dotenv
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=auto          # auto | local | openai_compat
LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL=BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
LOCAL_EMBEDDING_THREADS=4        # pin to the worker's CPU allocation
LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MAX_TEXTS_PER_CALL=256
LOCAL_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=32
```

`auto` embeds locally on CPU in local/testing and calls an OpenAI-compatible
service elsewhere. **On the local path, embedding — not extraction — dominates
ingestion cost**: measured at ~209s vs ~34s per document on a 100-paper corpus.
Three things govern it:

- **`LOCAL_EMBEDDING_THREADS`** is the one to set. Left at 0, ONNX Runtime sizes
  its thread pool from the *host's* CPU count rather than the container's cgroup
  limit and oversubscribes the cores it has. Measured directly on a 2-CPU
  container with bge-base: 604 ms/chunk unset against 264 ms/chunk pinned.
- **`LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MAX_TEXTS_PER_CALL`** bounds peak memory. A document is
  embedded per-document and a long paper can produce hundreds of chunks (533 for
  a 95-page paper), which held enough live at once to OOM-kill the worker.
- **`LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL`** trades quality for throughput:
  `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` measured ~3.4x faster on CPU (126 vs 432 ms/chunk on
  4 cores) at 384 dimensions, against MTEB retrieval 51.68 vs 53.25. **Changing
  it is a re-index** — the dimension is baked into each pod's vector column, so
  `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` must move with it and existing chunks must be
  re-embedded.

### Ingestion throughput and fairness

```dotenv
WORKER_LANES=                  # empty = all lanes; or interactive | bulk
WORKER_BULK_CONCURRENCY=2      # concurrent document extractions
DATASTORE_PER_POD_MAX_INFLIGHT=4
DATASTORE_DISPATCH_GLOBAL_BATCH=50
```

Document processing runs on the **bulk** worker lane, a separate Redis queue from
the **interactive** lane that serves agent runs, surface messages and workflow
resumes. A large upload therefore cannot occupy the slots interactive work needs.
`WORKER_BULK_CONCURRENCY` is the real cap on concurrent extractions and the main
lever on worker peak RAM.

Uploads beyond `DATASTORE_PER_POD_MAX_INFLIGHT` are intentionally not enqueued;
their rows stay `PENDING` in Postgres, which is the durable backlog, and a
per-minute dispatcher drains it round-robin across pods. So one tenant uploading
a thousand documents cannot monopolise ingestion, Redis depth stays bounded, and
every file is still processed eventually.

Leaving `WORKER_LANES` empty runs both lanes in one process. The local stack,
desktop and `make dev` embed the worker inside the API process and run *every*
lane unconditionally, ignoring `WORKER_LANES` — that process is the whole
deployment, so there is no second one a lane could be delegated to, and honouring
the variable there would let it silently leave a queue unconsumed. Split
deployments (a separate `python -m app.worker`) set `WORKER_LANES=interactive` on
one worker and `WORKER_LANES=bulk` on another; the interactive lane owns
process-wide startup, so at least one process must run it.

## Observability

Off by default. [Observability](observability.md) documents the full OTel
surface, including the separate `LLM_OTEL_*` pipeline for model-call traces.

```dotenv
OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=lemma-backend
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.05
# How often the worker samples queue depth and pending event rows. Matching the
# metric export interval is the useful floor; sampling faster only costs
# queries. Zero disables the backlog gauges.
BACKLOG_GAUGE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60
```

Set `LEMMA_RELEASE_SHA` too — see [Release identity](#release-identity). Without
it every signal reports `service.version=unknown` and nothing correlates to a
deploy.

## Chat surfaces

Each surface needs its own credentials, and none is required — a surface with no
token is simply inactive. Local installs have no public URL, so they receive
events by polling or socket instead of webhooks.

Slack has no bot token setting. A Slack surface uses the bot token stored on
the Slack connector account it is attached to, which somebody connects through
OAuth. The environment names the Slack app that OAuth runs against; an
organization can register its own app on the Slack connector's auth config
instead, and that app's signing secret is stored there too.

```dotenv
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=              # this deployment's Slack app
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=         # verifies webhook events from that app
SLACK_APP_ID=                 # matches an event to that app
ENABLE_SLACK_SOCKET_MODE=false
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=              # app-level token, Socket Mode only

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
ENABLE_TELEGRAM_POLLING_MODE=false

WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=
MICROSOFT_BOT_APP_ID=
```

## Frontend

The frontend reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables, which are applied at runtime.
`lemma-harness/.env.example` is the working list.

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://app.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=https://app.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPS_DOMAIN_SUFFIX=apps.example.com
```

## Container runtime selection

`LEMMA_CONTAINER_RUNTIME` selects which container CLI the local stack drives —
`docker`, `podman`, `lemma_local`, or `auto` to detect. It is read by Lemma
Desktop and `lemma-stack`, not by the backend, and it is not the same thing as
`WORKSPACE_PROVIDER`: the stack derives that from this, and the two accept
different values.

## Everything else

Settings not covered here are declared in these classes. Each field carries a
description, a default, and the validation that applies to it, which is the
authoritative answer for anything this document does not name.

| Area | Class |
| --- | --- |
| Core runtime, database, URLs, storage, models, observability | `lemma-backend/app/core/config.py` |
| Sandboxes and function runtimes | `lemma-backend/app/modules/workspace/config.py` |
| Agents | `lemma-backend/app/modules/agent/config.py` |
| Chat surfaces | `lemma-backend/app/modules/agent_surfaces/config.py` |
| Connectors | `lemma-backend/app/modules/connectors/config.py` |
| Datastore and document processing | `lemma-backend/app/modules/datastore/config.py` |
| Pod bundles | `lemma-backend/app/modules/pod_bundle/config.py` |
| Apps, icons, schedules | `app/modules/{apps,icon,schedule}/config.py` |
| Event transport | `lemma-backend/app/core/infrastructure/events/config.py` |

Settings whose description begins with `TEST HOOK ONLY` exist for the end-to-end
suite and should never be set in a real deployment.

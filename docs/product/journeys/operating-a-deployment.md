# Operating a deployment

**Journey:** Someone responsible for a Lemma deployment knows what it is doing,
what it is costing, and that it will behave when something goes wrong.

This journey is for the person who owns the deployment rather than the person
doing the work in it — though in a small organization they are the same person.
It covers what the platform owes them: honest numbers, limits that hold, and
failure that is visible rather than silent.

The promise: nothing important fails quietly. A deployment can be under-resourced,
mis-configured, or running out of budget, and in every case the platform says so
rather than degrading in a way that only shows up as confused users.

## Capability: Know what is being used

### PS-OPS-001 — An organization can see what its model work cost
**Status:** covered

- When someone entitled to it asks for an organization's usage, the system shall
  report what was spent over a period, broken down by what spent it.
- The system shall record every model run, including runs it could not price.
- Where a model's price is unknown, the system shall still record the run and
  shall mark the cost as unknown rather than recording it as zero.
- If a person who is not entitled to an organization's usage asks for it, then
  the system shall refuse.

**Contracts:** `usage.organization.summary.get`, `usage.organization.events.list`, `usage.organization.stats.get`

### PS-OPS-002 — A person can see their own usage
**Status:** covered

- When a person asks for their own usage in an organization, the system shall
  report it without requiring administrative access.
- The system shall keep one person's usage from revealing another's.

- Members can inspect their own activity without organization reporting privileges. Shared allowance percentages do not grant access to shared dollar totals or other members' records.

**Contracts:** `usage.organization.me.summary.get`, `usage.me.summary.get`, `usage.me.events.list`, `usage.me.stats.get`

### PS-OPS-003 — Usage records are a ledger, not a cache
**Status:** covered

- The system shall keep settled usage unchanged. A pending request journal
  entry may be completed when its provider receipt arrives; replaying that
  receipt shall not charge it again.
- The system shall attribute every record to the run, the model, and the person
  or workload behind it.
- The system shall record a run's usage whether it succeeded or failed, because
  a failed run still costs.

**Contracts:** `usage.organization.events.list`, `agent_run.completed`

---

## Capability: Stay inside limits

### PS-OPS-010 — Limits are visible before they are hit
**Status:** covered

- When someone asks what limits apply to an organization, the system shall
  report them and how much is used.
- Where a deployment sets no limit, the system shall say so plainly rather than
  reporting a limit of zero or an absent one.

- Chat exposes allowances on demand with percent used and reset times. It shows the applicable plan, including all windows enforced by that plan. Personal allowances exclude organization-funded activity.
- Unknown or loading usage is never displayed as zero or unlimited. In-flight overshoot remains visible even when the progress bar is full.

**Contracts:** `usage.organization.limits.get`, `usage.me.limits.get`

### PS-OPS-011 — Unpriced work remains available without monetary limits
**Status:** covered

- Where no monetary limit applies, the system shall allow an unpriceable model
  and record its usage as unpriced.
- Where a monetary limit applies, the system shall require a price and supported
  usage reporting before spending, and explain what configuration is missing.

**Contracts:** `usage.organization.limits.get`, `agent_run.completed`

### PS-OPS-012 — Exceeding a limit is refused clearly, not degraded
**Status:** covered

- If recorded usage has reached a configured limit, then the system shall refuse
  a new run or provider request and explain that the allowance is exhausted.
- The system shall not silently downgrade a model, shorten a run, or drop work
  to stay inside a limit.
- When a limit resets, the system shall allow work again without intervention.
- Ongoing runs shall check current shared usage before each model request and
  record actual usage immediately afterward. Requests already admitted may
  finish and overshoot the limit, including concurrent requests. Their full
  reported costs shall be recorded and successful responses preserved.
- An interrupted request without a final usage receipt shall remain identifiable
  as pending or unconfirmed. The system shall not invent its cost or report it
  as confirmed free work.

**Contracts:** `usage.organization.limits.get`

## Capability: Delete cleanly

### PS-OPS-020 — Deleting a pod actually stops everything it was doing
**Status:** covered

- When a pod is deleted, the system shall stop its schedules, its surfaces, and
  its standing work, and shall keep them stopped.
- The system shall not leave a timer, a webhook registration, or a sandbox
  running for a pod that no longer exists.
- The system shall stop answering for anything inside a deleted pod, on every
  route, whoever is asking.
- The system shall leave every other pod's data and running work untouched.

**Contracts:** `pod.delete`, `pod.deleted`

### PS-OPS-021 — A person can take their data out
**Status:** covered

- When someone entitled to it exports a pod, the system shall include the pod's
  data as well as its definitions.
- The system shall make the export readable without Lemma, so that leaving the
  platform does not mean losing the work.

**Contracts:** `pod.bundle.export.start`, `pod.bundle.download`

---

## Capability: Know when the platform itself is unwell

### PS-OPS-030 — The platform reports its own health honestly
**Status:** covered

- The system shall expose whether it is alive and whether it is ready to serve,
  as separate answers, because a process that is running and a process that can
  work are different things.
- If a component the platform depends on is unavailable, then the system shall
  report itself unready rather than accepting work it cannot complete.
- The system shall not report itself healthy while its background workers are
  wedged.

**Contracts:** *(health endpoints are outside the documented API surface)*

### PS-OPS-031 — Work that cannot be completed is not lost silently
**Status:** manual

- If a background job fails repeatedly, then the system shall stop retrying it
  and shall keep it somewhere an operator can find it.
- The system shall let an operator see what has been given up on, rather than
  discovering it through a user report.
- The system shall not drop an event because nothing was listening at the time
  it was published.

> **Verified by:** `test_dead_letter_e2e.py` in `app/core/tests/e2e/`, not by
> a scenario. Every clause needs a dependency to fail repeatedly on demand, and
> the scenario suite forbids mocking, so it has no way to induce one — see
> [testing.md](../../testing.md) on which suite owns injected failure. The two
> tests there drive a real dispatcher against a real outbox with a broker that
> always raises, and hold the retry budget stopping, the row being kept with
> its error type, a dead-lettered event not being claimed again, and an
> operator finding it and replaying it.
>
> This previously read `covered` on the strength of
> `test_feedback_can_be_reported`, which reports a broken *tool* and has
> nothing to do with dead-lettering.

**Contracts:** *(operational; see [Reliability](../../../lemma-backend/docs/operators/reliability.md))*

### PS-OPS-032 — A deployment can be configured for its own region and rules
**Status:** manual

- Where a deployment is subject to particular data-residency rules, the system
  shall let its operator point outbound telemetry and analytics at their own
  region.
- The system shall let an operator turn off product analytics entirely, and
  shall keep working when they do.
- The system shall never send a person's content, prompts, or model
  input and output to analytics.

> **Verified by:** an operator, at deployment time. Both halves are
> configuration rather than API — where telemetry is sent, and whether
> product analytics run at all — so what a scenario could check is that the
> platform works with analytics off, which is how this suite already runs.
> See [Configuration](../../configuration.md).

**Contracts:** *(configuration; see [Configuration](../../configuration.md) and [Product analytics](../../design/product-analytics.md))*

## Desktop settings

### PS-OPS-040 — This computer's settings keep drafts until saved or discarded
**Status:** manual

- While a person edits a form in Settings → This Mac, the system shall preserve
  their draft during health refreshes, while they move between settings
  sections, and after they close Settings, until the page is reloaded.
- While a form holds unsaved changes, the system shall say so on that form and
  keep it open.
- When a person chooses Save, the system shall save that form alone and report
  the outcome on it.
- If a form cannot be saved, the system shall retain its draft and display the
  failure on that form.
- When a person chooses Discard changes, the system shall restore that form to
  the saved values.
- The system shall never display a stored credential; it shall show only that
  one is saved, and remove one only when the person asks to.

> **Verified by:** installed-app QA on each supported platform: edit two
> forms, wait for a health refresh, move to another section and back, close
> and reopen Settings, save one with an invalid value, then discard the other.
> Confirm saved values after reopening. `lemma-frontend/tests/this-mac.test.ts`
> covers what a save sends; it does not replace the native window/IPC check.

**Contracts:** *(native desktop IPC; see [Desktop architecture](../../architecture/desktop.md))*

### PS-OPS-041 — Desktop reopens the last workspace page after Quit
**Status:** manual

- When a person confirms Quit while viewing a local workspace page, the system
  shall remember that page before replacing it with shutdown progress.
- When that installation next starts successfully on the same desktop release,
  the system shall reopen the remembered workspace page.
- The system shall not remember an installer, recovery page, or a page outside
  that installation's workspace origin as the workspace resume destination.
- When Settings is open over that page, confirmed Quit shall dismiss it so
  shutdown progress remains visible.

> **Verified by:** installed-app QA: open one conversation, close the window to
> the tray, reopen it, navigate to a different conversation, and confirm Quit.
> Verify owned processes stop. Launch again and verify the second conversation
> opens with its durable transcript. Repeat with Settings open over that page.

**Contracts:** *(native desktop lifecycle; see [Desktop architecture](../../architecture/desktop.md))*

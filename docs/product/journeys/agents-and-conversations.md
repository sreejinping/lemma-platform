# Agents and conversations

**Journey:** A person puts an agent on the work in a pod, talks to it, and stays
in control of what it does.

An agent is a named thing in a pod with instructions, a set of tools, and a
model behind it. A conversation is a thread with one. Everything an agent can
reach — tables, files, functions, workflows, connectors — is something a person
granted it, and everything it does is attributable to the person it acted for.

The promise here is control without supervision: a person should be able to hand
an agent real work, walk away, and be confident it cannot do anything they did
not permit — and that anything genuinely consequential comes back to them before
it happens.

People shall be able to copy their messages and teammate replies, including
separately copying code blocks, tables, quotes and expandable sections. Copy
controls shall be reachable by keyboard and on touch screens, and shall report
whether copying succeeded.

## Capability: Define an agent

### PS-AGENT-001 — A person creates an agent and gives it a job
**Status:** covered

- When a person creates an agent with instructions, the system shall make it
  available in that pod.
- Authored agent instructions shall contain at most 60,000 Unicode characters.
  Creation and instruction edits above that limit shall be rejected without
  truncating text or replacing the saved instruction. This is a text-size limit,
  not an exact token budget for the assembled runtime prompt.
- When an agent is created, the system shall record `agent.created`.
- The system shall let a person choose which sets of tools an agent may use, and
  shall give it no tools beyond those.
- Where an agent declares the shape of its output, the system shall hold its
  answers to that shape.
- If a person creates an agent whose name collides with an existing agent in the
  pod, then the system shall refuse.

**Contracts:** `agent.create`, `agent.get`, `agent.list`, `agent.created`

### PS-AGENT-002 — An agent gets only the access it was granted
**Status:** covered

- When a person grants an agent access to a table, a file, a function, or a
  workflow, the system shall allow exactly that and refuse everything else.
- When a person asks what an agent may reach, the system shall answer completely
  — every resource and every permission on it.
- While an agent acts on a person's behalf, the system shall give it no more
  access than that person has, even where the agent's own grants allow more.
- When a person changes an agent's grants, the system shall apply the change to
  the next run and not to one already in flight.
- When a person grants an agent pod data or a connected app, the system shall
  give it the tools to use that grant without asking them to enable anything
  else — a capability the grant already implies is not a second decision.
- The system shall not let that inference widen access: tools it turns on are
  still scoped by the grant that turned them on, and a grant on one kind of
  resource shall not imply tools for another.
- The system shall give every agent the ability to ask a person a question and
  to request approval, whatever else it was or was not granted.

**Contracts:** `agent.permissions.get`, `agent.permissions.replace`

### PS-AGENT-003 — A pod has an agent without anyone creating one
**Status:** covered

- The system shall give every pod a default agent, so a person can ask a
  question before building anything.
- The system shall give the default agent exactly the access of whoever is
  talking to it, and no standing access of its own.
- The system shall list the default agent alongside the agents a person created,
  so anything that can name an agent -- a schedule, a surface, a picker -- can
  name it too.
- When a person deletes an agent they created, the system shall keep the default
  agent available. The default agent itself shall not be deletable.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.create`, `agent.list`

### PS-AGENT-005 — A person gives an agent a memory
**Status:** covered

- When a person gives an agent memory, the system shall let it keep durable
  facts between conversations — shared with the pod, or private to the person it
  learned them from.
- When a person gives an agent memory, the system shall also give it the access
  it needs to write there, so the capability works without a second step.
- When a person takes memory away, the system shall take that access back.
- The system shall not give an agent memory it was never granted, and shall not
  carry one person's private facts into another person's conversation.
- The system shall bound how much remembered text is loaded into a run, so one
  overlong note cannot crowd out the rest.

**Contracts:** `agent.create`, `agent.update`, `agent.permissions.get`

### PS-AGENT-004 — A person chooses which model an agent uses
**Status:** covered

- Where an organization configures its own model provider, the system shall let
  its agents use it.
- Where an agent pins no model, the system shall fall back to the pod's default,
  and then to the deployment's.
- The system shall keep provider credentials secret — never returning them to
  any client, in any response, at any privilege level.
- If the provider refuses the key a person gives when adding it, then the
  system shall not add the provider, and shall say the key was rejected.
- If a configured provider is unreachable, then the system shall fail the run
  with a message saying the provider failed, rather than silently using a
  different one.

**Contracts:** `agent.runtime.profiles.create`, `agent.runtime.profiles.list`, `agent.runtime.profiles.update`, `agent.update`

---

## Capability: Talk to an agent

### PS-AGENT-010 — A person starts a conversation and gets an answer
**Status:** covered

- When a person starts a conversation with an agent, the system shall create the
  thread and record `conversation.started`.
- When a person sends a message, the system shall run the agent and persist both
  the question and the answer to the thread.
- When a run reaches a conclusion, the system shall record
  `agent_run.completed` with how it ended and what it cost.
- The system shall keep the full history of a conversation readable afterwards,
  including what tools were called and what they returned.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.create`, `agent.conversation.message.send`, `agent.conversation.message.list`, `conversation.started`, `agent_run.completed`

### PS-AGENT-011 — A person watches the answer arrive
**Status:** covered

- While an agent is working, the system shall stream its output to a person
  watching, as it is produced.
- The system shall stream what the agent is doing, not only what it is saying,
  so a person can see a long tool call is in progress rather than assuming it
  has stalled.
- When a watcher connects to a run already in progress, the system shall give
  them what has happened so far and then continue live.
- The system shall record an agent's reasoning as reasoning, and shall never
  present it as the agent's answer or return it as a run's result — however the
  model chose to write it.
- When a run ends, the system shall close the stream.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.stream`, `agent.conversation.get`

### PS-AGENT-012 — A person can stop an agent
**Status:** covered

- When a person stops a run, the system shall stop it and shall keep whatever
  the agent had produced up to that point.
- When a person stops a run, the system shall stop the work it had started where
  it can, and shall leave the conversation usable for the next message.
- The system shall never leave a stopped run appearing to still be working.
- If a person stops a run that has already finished, then the system shall leave
  its result unchanged.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.stop`, `agent.conversation.get`

### PS-AGENT-013 — A failed run can be tried again
**Status:** covered

- When a person retries a failed run, the system shall run it again from the
  last message rather than from the beginning of the conversation.
- The system shall not duplicate the work a failed run already completed where
  that work had lasting effects.
- If a person retries a run that did not fail, then the system shall refuse.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.retry`, `agent.conversation.get`

### PS-AGENT-015 — A person can add to what the agent is already doing
**Status:** covered

- When a person sends a message while a run is in flight, the system shall
  accept it rather than making them wait for the run to end.
- The system shall answer that message within the conversation, whichever
  harness is running it: steered into the turn already working where the
  harness can take it, and answered by a follow-up run where it cannot. A
  message shall never be accepted and then left unanswered.
- The system shall record whether the message joined a run already working or
  started one, so a person can be told which happened rather than watching an
  apparently unanswered message.
- The system shall not require a second event stream for a run that already has
  one.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.message.append`, `agent.conversation.message.list`

### PS-AGENT-016 — Everyday requests finish while the person waits
**Status:** covered

- When a person asks the pod's default agent for everyday work — an answer from
  the pod's tables, a change to a doc, a new record, a file made from the pod's
  data, a quick look-up on the web, something to remember — the system shall
  finish it while they wait, on the model the deployment is configured with:
  an answer, a record or a change to a doc within 30 seconds; a file or a web
  look-up within 45 seconds; a formatted document such as a PDF or a Word
  document within 90 seconds; a short research memo drawn from several web
  sources, with those sources cited, within two minutes.
- The system shall do what the request named: the record is in the table, the
  file is at the path asked for, and a doc is changed only where asked.
- While a person is waiting, the system shall spend the time on the work: it
  shall not re-check what a tool has already reported, render or screenshot
  what it has just written in order to check it, or build machinery a plain
  answer does not need.
- When a conversation is attached to a doc, the system shall give the agent the
  doc as it reads at the start of each run, so that a request about the doc
  does not begin by reading it.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.create`, `agent.conversation.message.append`, `agent.conversation.get`

### PS-AGENT-014 — A conversation is private to the pod
**Status:** covered

- The system shall show a conversation only to people entitled to it in its pod.
- If a person from another pod or another organization attempts to read a
  conversation, then the system shall refuse and shall not reveal that it exists.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.get`, `agent.conversation.list`

---

## Capability: Stay in control of what the agent does

### PS-AGENT-020 — Consequential actions come back to a person first
**Status:** covered

- If an agent attempts something destructive — dropping a table, deleting
  records in bulk, sending a message outside the pod — then the system shall
  pause the run and ask a person before doing it.
- While a run is paused for approval, the system shall keep it paused
  indefinitely rather than timing out and proceeding.
- When a person approves, the system shall resume the run and perform exactly
  the action that was described to them.
- When a person denies, the system shall resume the run without performing the
  action and shall let the agent report that it was refused.
- Where a person approves an action for the rest of the session, the system
  shall stop asking for that action in that session only, and shall ask again in
  the next one.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.approval.list`, `agent.conversation.approval.resolve`, `agent.conversation.get`

### PS-AGENT-021 — An agent can ask a person a question mid-run
**Status:** covered

- When an agent needs something only a person can supply, the system shall pause
  the run and present the question.
- When the person answers, the system shall resume the run with their answer.
- The system shall present the question wherever the conversation is happening,
  including on an external surface, rather than only in the workspace.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.message.send`, `agent.conversation.get`

### PS-AGENT-022 — Every action is attributable
**Status:** covered

- The system shall record, for every action an agent takes, which agent took it
  and on whose behalf.
- The system shall keep approvals and denials as a durable record, readable
  afterwards.
- The system shall never let an agent's action appear to have been taken
  directly by a person.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.approval.list`, `agent.conversation.message.list`

---

## Capability: Wait for something to finish

### PS-AGENT-023 — A run can wait for something without occupying a turn
**Status:** covered

- Where an agent has nothing to do until a time passes, a command it started
  finishes, or a sub-agent it started finishes, the system shall let it wait for
  exactly one of those and shall end its turn.
- While a run waits, the system shall hold its state durably, so that a restart
  of the platform does not lose it.
- When the thing a run waits on resolves, the system shall resume the run where
  it stopped, and shall tell it which of those resolved it.
- The system shall resume a run exactly once for a given resolution, even if the
  resolution is reported more than once.
- While a run waits on a command it started, the system shall keep that
  command's workspace running.
- The system shall give every wait a limit, and when that limit passes the system
  shall resume the run and shall say that the wait expired rather than that the
  thing finished.
- If a resolution is never reported, then the system shall notice the run is
  stuck and shall resolve it rather than leaving it waiting indefinitely.
- When a person stops a conversation that is waiting, the system shall end the
  wait and shall not resume the run.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.get`, `agent.conversation.message.list`

---

## Capability: Give an agent more than one thing to do

### PS-AGENT-030 — An agent can delegate to a subagent
**Status:** covered

- Where an agent starts a subagent, the system shall run it as a child of the
  original conversation and shall return its result to the parent.
- The system shall give a subagent no more access than its parent has.
- The system shall show a person the subagent's work as part of the parent
  conversation, rather than hiding it.

**Contracts:** `agent.conversation.create`, `agent.conversation.get`

### PS-AGENT-031 — An agent can show a person something interactive
**Status:** covered

- Where an agent produces an interactive result, the system shall render it in
  the conversation and shall let a person interact with it.
- The system shall scope access to such a result to the conversation it belongs
  to, and shall expire it.
- If someone without access to the conversation opens the result, then the
  system shall refuse.

**Contracts:** `widget.embed_token`, `agent.conversation.get`

---

## Capability: Run an agent on your own machine

### PS-AGENT-040 — A person pairs a local agent host with their account
**Status:** covered

- When a person pairs an agent host, the system shall bind it to their account
  and shall let them see it in their list of hosts.
- The system shall let a person revoke a host at any time, from either end.
- When a host is revoked, the system shall stop dispatching work to it
  immediately.

**Contracts:** `agent.host.pairing.create`, `agent.host.list`, `agent.host.revoke`
(the machine's half -- spending the code, and revoking from its own end -- is
the `pair` and `revoke` frames on the host's link WebSocket, which has no
OpenAPI operation)

### PS-AGENT-041 — Work dispatched to a host runs exactly once
**Status:** covered

- The system shall dispatch a given run to exactly one host, even when a host
  reconnects while that run is in flight.
- If a host disappears mid-run, then the system shall mark the run failed rather
  than leaving it appearing to run.
- The system shall show a person what their host is running and what it has run.
- A conversation shall save its working directory when created. Dispatched
  local sessions shall open and resume using that same saved directory, with
  the sandbox root (`~/lemma`) mapped to `~/lemma` on the computer. Existing
  provider sessions shall retain their previous directory across upgrades.

**Contracts:** `agent.host.harnesses.list` (dispatch itself travels on the
host's link WebSocket -- `control`, `commands` and `events` frames -- which has
no OpenAPI operation)

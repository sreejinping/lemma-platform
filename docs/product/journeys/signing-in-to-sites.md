# Signing in to sites

**Journey:** An agent working in a browser meets a login wall on a site the
platform has no connector for, and a person gets it past — without ever being
asked for a password, and without having to do it again next week.

This is the sibling of [connectors and accounts](connectors-and-accounts.md),
and the difference is the mechanism, not the principle. A connector holds a
credential a provider issued for programmatic use. Here there is no such
credential to hold: the site has a login form and nothing else. So what is kept
is what a browser keeps — the session that exists *after* somebody has signed
in — and the person signs in themselves, in the agent's browser, exactly as they
would anywhere.

The promise is the same one: a person's way in is theirs, and nothing uses it
except on their behalf. The mechanism is now the plainest one available — the
session stays in the browser that was signed in, in that person's own computer,
and never leaves it. Lemma keeps no copy to encrypt, show or lose.

Two things follow from that, and they are load-bearing rather than incidental.

**A password is never asked for and never stored.** `PS-CONN-021` already
promises the system will never ask somebody for their provider password, and
that promise does not become weaker because the site has no consent screen. The
person types their password into the site, in a browser, the way they always do.
What remains afterwards is the session — weaker than a password, revocable by
logging out, and useless anywhere but that site.

**The session is scoped the way a browser scopes it.** An agent's browser
visits many places, and each site sees only what it set: its own cookies, its
own storage, under the origin rules every browser enforces. Nothing here
re-implements that scoping, which is the point — the previous design read a
session out of the browser and had to decide for itself what belonged to whom,
and that decision was where it went wrong.

## Capability: Get past a login wall

### PS-BROWSER-010 — An agent that meets a login wall asks, and waits
**Status:** gap

> **Gap:** the capability is there and the scenario suite does not prove it.
> The whole journey -- ask, pause, sign in, capture, resume, reuse, remove --
> runs against a real sandbox and a real browser in
> `workspace/tests/e2e/test_signing_in_to_a_site_e2e.py`, and a paused sign-in
> now reaches a surface as a link. But the only scenario naming this promise
> asserts that somebody else's request is not found, which proves a refusal
> rather than the promise, and the coverage gate cannot tell those apart. This
> stays `gap` until a scenario proves it, rather than being marked covered by a
> test that does not.

- When an agent needs a site whose browser is not signed in, the system shall
  ask the person to sign in themselves and shall put that site in front of them.
- The system shall never ask a person for a site password, and an agent shall
  never type one.
- The system shall pause the run until the person answers, however long that
  takes, rather than failing or timing out.
- The system shall reach the person wherever they are, with a link that opens
  only for them.

**Contracts:** `web_login.sign_in.pending`

### PS-BROWSER-011 — A person can tell what they are signing in to
**Status:** manual

> **Verified by:** driving the live view against a real sandbox browser, which
> is where the host and the padlock come from. A scenario cannot read what is
> painted on a canvas.

- Before a person types anything, the system shall show which site the browser
  is actually on and whether the connection is protected.
- The system shall show the agent's own words for why it is asking, as the
  agent's words.

**Contracts:** `web_login.sign_in.pending`

### PS-BROWSER-012 — Finishing resumes the run, and says whether it was kept
**Status:** covered

- When a person says they have signed in, the system shall check the browser
  before agreeing, and shall say so plainly when it cannot find a signed-in
  session.
- The system shall tell both the person and the agent whether the login was kept
  for next time, and why it was not when it was not.
- When a person declines, the system shall tell the agent so it can do the task
  another way or stop, rather than leaving it waiting.

**Contracts:** `web_login.sign_in.answer`

## Capability: Keep a way back in

### PS-BROWSER-020 — A login is the person's own, and it stays
**Status:** covered

- The agent's browser shall keep its own session for a site the person signed
  in to, and that session shall survive the browser closing, the computer
  being suspended, and the conversation ending.
- The system shall never carry a session's contents out of the person's own
  computer: what leaves it is which sites have one and when they lapse.
- The system shall not let one person's browser session be used by another
  person.
- While the browser is still signed in to a site, the system shall not ask
  that person for it again.

**Contracts:** `web_login.list`

### PS-BROWSER-021 — A login that has stopped working says so
**Status:** manual

> **Verified by:** a real sandbox against a site whose session can be expired on
> demand: opening it lands on the login form, the agent is told the browser is
> not signed in, and the person is asked again. Nothing in the scenario lane can
> expire somebody else's session.

- When a site no longer accepts the browser's session, the system shall ask
  the person again rather than failing the task the same way twice.

**Contracts:** `web_login.list`

### PS-BROWSER-022 — A person sees and undoes what their browser holds
**Status:** covered

- The system shall show a person every site their agent's browser is signed
  in to, and roughly how long each will last.
- The system shall let a person sign it out of any of them.
- Signing out shall actually sign the browser out of that site, and shall
  leave anywhere the person is signed in themselves untouched.
- The system shall refuse rather than report success when the computer is not
  running to be changed.

**Contracts:** `web_login.delete`

## Capability: Watch the agent's browser

### PS-BROWSER-030 — A person can watch, and drive, their own browser
**Status:** gap

> **Gap:** proved, but not here. Watching and driving are now covered end to
> end by `test_a_person_watches_the_agents_browser_and_then_drives_it` in the
> workspace e2e suite: the agent's own tool opens a page, a socket carries a
> real JPEG of it back, input from a watching socket is refused, and a click
> from a driving one navigates the page. That needs a real browser in a real
> container, which this suite has no way to stand up -- the same reason the
> sign-in flow lives there, noted at the top of `test_saved_logins.py`. The
> only scenario naming this promise asserts that *asking* about the browser
> starts nothing, which is one true corner of it; until the promise can be
> proved black-box over the shipped API, it is recorded as a gap here rather
> than claimed.

- The system shall let a person see what the browser in their own workspace is
  doing, and shall not start a paused workspace merely to answer whether it can.
- The system shall let that person drive it, and shall refuse input from a view
  that is only watching.
- The system shall not let anyone else watch or drive another person's browser.
- A viewer shall be able to move the pointer, type, and scroll, and shall not be
  able to make the browser do anything else.
- A person driving the browser shall be able to paste text using their native
  keyboard shortcut.
- Where floating windows are supported, a person shall be able to pop out the
  browser and bring it back. Leaving the Computer view shall close its viewer.
- While the workspace starts, the Computer view shall show startup status and
  measured download progress when available, rather than reporting it asleep.

**Contracts:** `workspace.browser.status`

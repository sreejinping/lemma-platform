# Chat and email-code onboarding

Email-code login uses the OSS SuperTokens passwordless recipe internally. Lemma
owns challenge endpoints, mailbox verification and canonical account selection;
the recipe's public signup and consume endpoints are disabled. Configure normal
transactional email delivery and the auth frontend origin before enabling it.
Codes last at most ten minutes, allow three wrong attempts and require a
sixty-second resend wait. Web and chat share email send limits.

Apply backend migrations before starting the API and worker. Both must run the
same version: the worker consumes `surface.onboarding.ready` from the normal
transactional outbox. Pending requests are stored outside pod conversations and
purged after handoff, cancellation or expiry. Keep the worker running for replay
and expiry cleanup. Do not log webhook form contents or email codes.

## Web authentication and local verification

The user-facing auth screens live in `lemma-frontend`. Both sign-in and signup
first mint a browser binding at `/auth/email-code/browser`, then submit the email
to `/auth/email-code/continue`. Its `method` selects a password form, Google or
Microsoft, or an email-code challenge. Passwordless accounts created through chat
use the code branch and retain their canonical identity. `/start` is the explicit
code endpoint; it does not select an existing account's login method.

Set backend `AUTH_FRONTEND_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` to the actual new frontend
origin, including its port in local development. The browser Origin must match
one of those origins. Cookie binding, JSON requests and origin checks remain
required; CORS configuration alone does not authorize an email-code request.
`EMAIL_LOGIN_ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED` indicates a deployment configuration mismatch,
not that the address belongs to a Google account.

Root Makefile defaults now point backend auth and frontend URLs at the workspace
on port 3000. Start the backend with the normal local stack and run
`make dev-frontend` for `lemma-frontend`; override `DEV_WORKSPACE_PORT` consistently
in both commands when choosing another port. The operator harness remains on
`DEV_FRONTEND_PORT` and is not the user auth frontend. Existing custom environment
files or deployment overrides must also use the new frontend's origin.

Email-code failures expose a stable top-level `code` alongside `message`.
Clients should use `EMAIL_LOGIN_EXPIRED` to restart the browser binding,
`EMAIL_CODE_EXPIRED` to request a replacement, and `EMAIL_CODE_RATE_LIMITED` with
`Retry-After` to delay another request. Invalid codes use `EMAIL_CODE_INVALID`;
configuration, invalid input, delivery, challenge lifecycle and proof failures
have their own codes. Do not infer recovery actions from HTTP 403 alone.

For browser regression checks, run `npm run test:auth-browser` in
`lemma-frontend`. That suite uses controlled API responses. For actual signup,
sign-in, verification mail, password reset, code exhaustion and resend, boot an
**isolated** local backend with Postgres, Redis and SuperTokens and set
`EMAIL_TRANSPORT=filesystem`, `EMAIL_OUTPUT_DIR` to a private inbox directory,
`AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=true` and matching frontend origins. Disable
email domain checks for the suite's reserved example addresses. Point the real
frontend at that API with verification enabled, then run:

```bash
cd lemma-frontend
LEMMA_AUTH_QA_ORIGIN=http://localhost:13009 \
LEMMA_AUTH_QA_API=http://localhost:18719 \
LEMMA_AUTH_QA_MAILBOX=/private/tmp/lemma-auth-qa/emails \
LEMMA_TEST_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome npm run test:auth-live
```

The live suite refuses non-loopback hosts, consumes only filesystem test mail,
creates uniquely named test accounts, and closes its browsers. It does not start
or stop the stack; its launcher must trap exit and tear down all owned processes
and services. It skips when the three `LEMMA_AUTH_QA_*` variables are absent.
Keep the inbox private: it contains usable test codes and reset links. Live
provider consent and WhatsApp transport require their own credentials and test
installations; seeded provider/passwordless identities verify routing and account
reuse, not those external transports.

## Shared WhatsApp and Telegram

Configure the existing shared WhatsApp number/token and Telegram bot token.
Telegram polling starts one receiver for the configured shared bot even before
any personal surfaces exist. Customer-connected bots continue to use their
existing surfaces and access rules.

Telegram requests the sender's own contact and accepts no typed phone proof.
WhatsApp derives phone proof from the authenticated webhook sender. Both support
typed email and code replies. Telegram also presents contact and setup controls.

A contact the sender shares is matched against profile mobile numbers. A
verified number always wins. Where `SURFACE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_PHONE_MATCH` is on,
a contact that matches nobody verified is matched against unverified profile
numbers too, and exactly one such profile is taken as its owner (logged as
`agent_surfaces.identity.unverified_phone_match_used.observed`); two or more
claims match nobody. A match completes signup with no email, and provisioning
stamps the number verified, since the self-shared contact has just proven it.
Lemma Desktop turns the setting on: its owner types their number on their
profile (or on Server setup's Telegram card), messages the bot and taps Share my
contact. Everywhere else it is off.

An account's email verification counts toward chat only where the deployment
requires it (`AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`). Where it is not required, an
active account with an unverified address is matched, provisioned and resolved
like any other; hosted Lemma requires it and is unchanged.

Signup otherwise ends on an emailed code, so the email step only runs where mail
reaches an inbox. On a deployment that cannot send mail — the filesystem spool
counts as none here, since nobody in a chat can read it — a sender the bot does
not recognise is told to add their number to their profile and share their
contact again, or to ask whoever runs this Lemma for an invitation, instead of
being asked for an address. The pending signup ends as `refused` (logged as
`agent_surfaces.chat_onboarding.email_unavailable.observed`), so their next
message starts afresh. Telegram still asks for the contact first; only the email
step is skipped.

WhatsApp can present two static Flows. From `lemma-backend/`, run
`uv run python scripts/publish_onboarding_flows.py` with `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`
and `WHATSAPP_WABA_ID` supplied through the operator environment. The publisher uploads and publishes the versioned email
and code definitions in `manifests/whatsapp/` and prints
the two configuration values. Configure both Flow IDs to enable native prompts;
typed replies remain available. The Flow token is opaque and bound to sender,
step and challenge. Test publishing and submission in the target WABA before
rolling out the native forms.

## Slack and Teams

Use the organization's existing installation. Slack needs permission to open a
DM and send messages, plus its normal interactivity callback. The setup button
opens a modal using a fresh interaction trigger. If the trigger expires, the
person can use the button again or reply privately with text.

Teams needs personal conversation support in the app manifest and tenant policy
that permits the bot to contact the person. Retain the authenticated Bot Framework
conversation reference. Email and code Adaptive Cards are delivered only in the
personal conversation. If proactive messaging is refused, the person can open
the personal bot chat and retry. Inspect existing webhook/worker failure
diagnostics for delivery errors; signup never falls back to a public channel.

A successful mailbox check creates or reuses an account. It does not bypass the
installation organization's membership policy. Invite-only organizations require
an administrator to add the person before a pod and personal route are created.
Other memberships do not change that destination. No credentials are copied to
the personal pod: execution carries the source installation separately from the
authorized target pod.

## Verification

Run the identity and agent-surfaces module e2e suites against Postgres, Redis and
unlicensed SuperTokens. Run the getting-started product scenarios through the
booted HTTP stack, and frontend auth tests for browser retry and redirect behavior.
Native-provider release verification additionally requires test installations for
Slack, Teams, WhatsApp and Telegram; provider fixtures do not prove tenant policy,
app permissions or published Flow acceptance.
